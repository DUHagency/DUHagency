#api 
The official IMDb API is available exclusively through [[AWS Data Exchange]]. To use it, you must have an AWS account and request access via the AWS Marketplace. The API is GraphQL-based and provides comprehensive metadata on movies, TV, OTT series, video games, and more, including ratings, box office data, and performer information.
