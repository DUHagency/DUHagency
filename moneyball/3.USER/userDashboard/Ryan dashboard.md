# Notes to Ryan (please relocate before deleting)

- Find wealthy people / developing business people around the age o 26 to 37 age range
	- *response* ==this is confusing, because all this can be started with almost no cost.  Build the presence of the site, and what the site is, eventually offer variable users for different accessibility roles towards the site.  I have never had success finding anyone that motivate, passionate or competent for really an in-depth pursuit.  Find investor maybe is doable; however we really could use a leadership structure with other to have a team to delegate tasks too.  That seems more useful than investment, but I don't know where to find them.==

	- [[angel investors in ohio]]
	- [[government resources for startups]]
- Make [[4.DUH/report/DUH business model]] page with at least 3 demo models

		 - [[Monetization]]
		 - [[4.USER/DUH/DUH Investment Strategy]]
- Communication, creating value for others
	- *response* ==this self evident, however the [[DUH discord]], is another story.  We need to curate a community, exactly of who idk.  I would like entrepreneurs . ==
