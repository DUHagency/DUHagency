# distribution notes
The most international appeal with your buck.  It makes Columbus Feel international.  The most excuses for a bunch of languages.  Hold rights back from streaming services.  Pursue rights based on episode and countries of language.  If copyright law is low, lol, give a provide the rights lol.

Color blind
The most common forms of color blindness in both men and women are types of red-green color vision deficiency, specifically:

- **:** Difficulty distinguishing between red and green hues due to altered or missing red cone cells.
    

- **:** Difficulty distinguishing between red and green hues due to altered or missing green cone cells.
    

These red-green deficiencies are far more prevalent in men—affecting up to 8% of males (1 in 12)—compared to only about 0.5% of females (1 in 200)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness)

[](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-is-color-blindness-more-common-in-males)[](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/). This is because the genes responsible are located on the X chromosome, and men have only one X chromosome, making them more susceptible
