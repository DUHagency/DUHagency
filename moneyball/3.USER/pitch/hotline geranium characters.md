This document will be turned into two documents.  *United States Dialects*, *United States Cultural Population*, & *Ohio Dialects* & *Ohio Cultural Populations*.

# Thinking of Covering Massive Pop
## Ohio
Ohio is predominantly White (about 77.8%), with Black or African American residents making up 12.3%, and Hispanic or Latino residents accounting for about 4.6% of the population[](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH/PST045224)[](https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/ohio-population-by-race/)[](https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/development.ohio.gov/research/Ohio-Hispanic-Latino-Population-2022.pdf). Among Hispanic Ohioans, those of Mexican origin are the largest subgroup[](https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/ohio-population-by-race/)
