# SAG
**Taft-Hartley**
The Taft-Hartley Act provides a valuable avenue for independent filmmakers to hire nonunion actors while still adhering to union guidelines. Established in 1947, this law allows producers working under SAG-AFTRA agreements to hire nonunion talent if a suitable union actor isnâ€™t available. The process helps nonunion performers become eligible for union membership, opening doors for future opportunities.
