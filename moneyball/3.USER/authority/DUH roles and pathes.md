At the agency the agents are the producers, they post the [bids](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=bids), they find the [talent](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=talent). They are responsible for finding investments, managing events, information, talent and accounts. This degree of trust with a rather hands off approach as a studio must be met with strict boundaries. Which mean all agents must understand stats, and know two languages!.

- All commanding offices need an official studio registry with a language.
    - Only top ten languages accepting for commanding.
        - English 18.8%
        - Mandarin Chinese 13.8%
        - Hindi 7.5%
        - Spanish 6.9%

        - Urdu 2.9%
- All commanding offices are responsible for all cultural maintenance of the wiki.
- One commanding office per timezone per language.
- A commanding office must start as a satellite.
    - Satellites must work on immigration on that language, so must be located in applicable community.
- A commanding office must be within 30 minutes from a commercial airport.
    - closer the better
