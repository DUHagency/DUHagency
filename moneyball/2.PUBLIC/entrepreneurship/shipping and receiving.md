- Customs considerations: While cannabis seeds are legal, there's always a possibility that packages containing seeds could be inspected or held by customs. Reputable seed banks typically use discreet packaging to minimize this risk.
- Payment options: Some international seed banks may offer various payment methods to accommodate international customers, though options may be more limited than for domestic purchases.
- Strain selection: Ordering from international sources can provide access to a wider variety of cannabis strains and genetics that may not be available domestically.
- Shipping times: Keep in mind that ordering from outside the US may result in longer shipping times compared to domestic orders.
- Research vendors: It's important to choose reputable seed banks or vendors to ensure you receive high-quality, viable seeds and to minimize the risk of issues with shipping or customs.
