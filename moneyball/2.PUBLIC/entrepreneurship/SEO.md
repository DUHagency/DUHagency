Search engine optimization

**Optimize your content**

Create high-quality, engaging content that's structured for search engines to understand. Use relevant keywords in your title tags and meta descriptions. 

- **Improve your website's speed**
    Load time is a key factor in Google's Core Web Vitals, so fix broken links and improve your website's speed. 
- **Earn backlinks**
    Backlinks from other websites are a vote of confidence for Google, so the more you have, the more popular your site will appear. 
- **Create a Google Business Profile**
    Optimize your profile with accurate information, photos, and reviews. You can also add local SEO optimizations to help your profile stand out in Google Maps. 
- **Sign up for Google Authorship**
    
    This can help your articles get better exposure and display with more personalization and credibility. 
    

- **Set up a Google Search Console account**
    
    This gives you access to insights into search performance metrics, which you can use to optimize your site's visibility. 
    

- **Pay for ads**
    
    If you want to appear at the top of the results for your target keyword, you can sign up for [Google ads](https://ads.google.com/home/) and run a search campaign.
