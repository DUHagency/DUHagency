# Virtual ISP[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=becoming-an-isp#Virtual_ISP)

- why would this be used
- seems fucking terrible lol

Forming a virtual ISP involves entering into a formal agreement with an established facility-based provider that will supply the business with discounted connectivity services. The virtual ISP then sells the services at a markup to its own customers under its own name to generate business cash flow. Since most agreements require the virtual ISP to maintain minimum customer volumes, it is important for businesses entering the market to have a ready customer base and a strong marketing plan before signing a contract. Be sure to clearly define responsibilities for each partner at the outset to help avoid potential administrative and customer service issues.
