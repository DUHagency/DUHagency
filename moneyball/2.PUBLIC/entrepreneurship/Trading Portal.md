- **Daily Trading Limits**: There are no specific limits on the number of trades you can make in a day, but the above rules apply to ensure you maintain the required equity.
# always lose the money

Because we can have 4 trades a week, means we need to buy 4 things a week.  Insane grandeur confidence, means we can buy cover calls, cover puts.  We often will have insane emotions of confidence, see our guide on that here "[[always bet on what your elected politician bet on]]." Lol historically speaking for the last decade and all.
	However just because we need to buy 4 things a week, doesn't mean we are going to selling 4 week, this an insane unicorn like event.  The most right place right time, "why is this so expensive it shouldn't ever be this expensive.  Imp selling" type moment.

## buying significantly under valued
When considering trades, we want big daily moving average with a large market cap, and a regression formula utilizing a basic curve of annual price predictability.  Based on daily moving averages, we simply buy the price on the year, or predictable past year for a longer term average.
 For instance blackberry is bad example.
 Medicine not allowed, too hard.   No tech, too fast.  Food, agriculture, energy, airlines, media, transports.
