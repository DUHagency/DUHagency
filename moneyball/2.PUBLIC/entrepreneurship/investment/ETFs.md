# How to Find and Evaluate Undervalued ETFs

- **Use ETF screeners** on sites like Morningstar, Bankrate, or your brokerage platform. Filter for "value" or "undervalued" in the fund strategy.
    
- **Review fund fact sheets** for portfolio composition, valuation metrics (like price-to-earnings ratios), and recent performance.
    
- **Look for recent articles** or updates on financial news sites, as value opportunities can shift with market conditions.
