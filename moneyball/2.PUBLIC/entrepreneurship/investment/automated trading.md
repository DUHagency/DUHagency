#investments   
Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS): This is a powerful trading platform that allows you to create and automate trading strategies using their proprietary programming language (Python, C++, etc.). You can code custom algorithms to generate entry/exit signals and set dynamic stop-loss orders. TradingView: While primarily a charting platform, TradingView offers a "Pine Script" language to code custom indicators and trading strategies. You can backtest strategies and deploy them with automatic order execution, including stop-loss orders based on your logic. MetaTrader 4/5 (MT4/MT5): These are popular Forex trading platforms that also support stock trading. They allow you to use their built-in MQL programming language or integrate with third-party tools to build expert advisors (EAs) that can automate trades and risk management rules like stop-losses. Quantopian: This is a cloud-based platform specifically designed for quantitative trading. You can write and backtest trading algorithms in Python, including rules for position sizing and stop-loss exits, and execute them directly through brokers integrated with Quantopian. Tradestation: Tradestation's EasyLanguage allows you to program custom indicators, strategies, and order management (entry, stops, exits) which can then be auto-traded. Most of these platforms charge monthly fees for their advanced trading capabilities. You would also need to have a funded brokerage account to execute real trades.
