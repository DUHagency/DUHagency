# find undervalue
To find a list of the best mutual funds that are currently undervalued, you generally need to look for funds categorized as "value funds" or those focused on undervalued sectors or stocks. While there is no single definitive list of "undervalued" mutual funds published daily, several reputable financial sites and investment platforms regularly update rankings and recommendations for value-oriented and high-potential funds:

## Where to Find Lists of the Best (Potentially Undervalued) Mutual Funds

- **Economic Times** provides a regularly updated list of top mutual funds in India, including large cap, flexi cap, and hybrid funds, which often include value-oriented options. Their June 2025 list features funds like UTI Value Fund Direct - Growth, which specifically targets undervalued stocks[4](https://economictimes.com/mf/analysis/top-10-mutual-funds-to-invest-in-june-2025/articleshow/121586054.cms).
    
- **Dhan.co** offers detailed performance tables for mutual funds, including categories like "Value Fund" and "Contra Fund," both of which are designed to invest in undervalued companies. For example, UTI Value Fund Direct - Growth and SBI Contra Fund Direct - Growth are listed as options with a value or contrarian approach[1](https://dhan.co/mutual-funds/mf-to-invest/best-sip-for-5-years/).
    
- **Morningstar** and **Bankrate** regularly publish rankings and reviews of top mutual funds, including value and blend funds. While their lists focus on overall performance and ratings, you can filter for value funds or funds with a value tilt[2](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-mutual-funds/)[3](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-funds-rebalancing-2025).
    
- **Equitymaster** and other investment research sites often highlight large cap and value funds among their recommendations, such as ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund and HDFC Large Cap Fund[7](https://www.equitymaster.com/the-fundstrategist/detail.asp?date=06%2F12%2F2025&story=4&title=Best-Mutual-Funds-to-Consider-in-2025).

## How to Identify Undervalued Mutual Funds

- Look for funds labeled as "Value," "Contra," or "Flexi Cap"—these often seek undervalued stocks.
    
- Check recent performance: Undervalued funds may show lower short-term returns but strong long-term track records.
    
- Review the fund's portfolio and strategy on sites like Morningstar or Bankrate to confirm a value orientation[2](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-mutual-funds/)[3](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-funds-rebalancing-2025).
    

## Additional Tips

- Most financial portals (Morningstar, Bankrate, Economic Times, Dhan, etc.) allow you to filter or search for value or contra mutual funds.
    
- Always review the fund's fact sheet and holdings to ensure it aligns with your definition of "undervalued."
