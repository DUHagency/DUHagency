🔧 **Online Car Auction Sites**

These platforms let you bid on everything from daily drivers to salvage specials:

- **[SCA Auctions](https://sca.auction/locations/oh)** – Public auto auctions with locations in Ohio and nationwide. No dealer license needed.
- **[Auto Auction Mall](https://mechanicbase.com/market/best-online-car-auction-websites/)** – Access wholesale and salvage vehicles. Great for project cars or rebuilds.
- **[eBay Motors](https://mechanicbase.com/market/best-online-car-auction-websites/)** – Still a powerhouse for used cars, with both auctions and “Buy It Now” options.
- **[Cars & Bids](https://mechanicbase.com/market/best-online-car-auction-websites/)** – Focuses on enthusiast and modern classics, often at reasonable prices.

🏢 **Local & Regional Auctions (Ohio-based)**

- **Thompson Auctioneers** – Industrial and contractor auctions, often include work trucks and vans.
- **Columbus Fair Auto Auction** – Dealer-focused but sometimes open to the public.
- **GovDeals & Public Surplus** – Government fleet vehicles, often well-maintained and undervalued.

🛒 **Retailers with Clearance or Repo Deals**

- **CarMax Auctions** – Not open to the public, but if you have a dealer connection, it’s gold.
- **Enterprise Car Sales** – Former rentals, well-maintained, and often discounted.
- **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** – Still great for local steals if you know how to vet a seller.

🧰 Pro Tip: Salvage Titles = Big Savings

If you're comfortable with light repairs or cosmetic issues, salvage-title vehicles can be a steal. Just make sure you understand the rebuild process and local title laws.
