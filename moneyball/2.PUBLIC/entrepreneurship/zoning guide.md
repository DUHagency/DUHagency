- **Common Zoning Districts**
Most municipalities use similar categories for zoning, though the exact names and rules may vary. Typical zoning districts include:

- **Residential**: For homes, apartments, condos, and sometimes home-based businesses. Subcategories may specify single-family, multi-family, or high-density housing[7](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/zoning-laws)[5](https://www.yellowsprings.gov/egov/apps/document/center.egov?view=item%3Bid%3D2066).
- **Commercial**: For businesses such as offices, retail stores, hotels, and restaurants. Rules may address parking, building height, and proximity to other uses[7](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/zoning-laws).
- **Industrial**: For manufacturing, warehouses, and heavy commercial uses. These are often separated from residential areas due to noise or environmental impact[7](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/zoning-laws).
- **Agricultural**: For farming and related activities, often with protections against urban development[7](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/zoning-laws).
- **Historic**: To preserve buildings or areas with historical significance, sometimes offering tax incentives for preservation
