# Business
## **Public Companies Based in the NWT**

1. **Northwest Company Inc. (TSX: NWC)**
    
    - **Headquarters:** Winnipeg (operates heavily in NWT & Northern Canada)
        
    - **Business:** Retail (operates Northern Stores, NorthMart, and QuickStop in remote communities, including NWT).
        
    - **Note:** While technically headquartered in Winnipeg, it is the closest thing to a "NWT public company" due to its major operations in the territory.
        
2. **Diamond Fields Resources Inc. (TSXV: DFI)**
    
    - **Headquarters:** Yellowknife, NWT (previously, now more international-focused)
        
    - **Business:** Mineral exploration (formerly involved in NWT diamond mining but now operates globally).
        

## **Other Notable Companies with NWT Operations (But Not HQ’d There)**

- **De Beers (Private) / Mountain Province Diamonds (TSX: MPVD, NASDAQ: MPVD)**
    
    - Operates the **Gahcho Kué diamond mine** (NWT), but HQ’d in Toronto & New York.
        
- **Imperial Metals (TSX: III)**
    
    - Operates the **Yellow Giant gold mine** (past production), HQ’d in Vancouver.
        

## **Why So Few Public Companies in NWT?**

- **Small population & economy** (fewer than 50,000 people).
    
- **Most businesses are private or Indigenous-owned** (e.g., Arctic Co-operatives, Aurora Energy).
    
- **Resource projects often owned by outside majors** (e.g., Rio Tinto, BHP historically in diamonds).
