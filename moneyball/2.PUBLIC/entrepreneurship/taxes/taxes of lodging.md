**Large hotels with five or more sleeping rooms**: In Ohio, the state sales tax and Resort Area Gross Receipts Excise Tax apply specifically to establishments with five or more sleeping rooms[](https://www.avalara.com/mylodgetax/en/resources/vacation-rental-tax-guides/ohio.html). This means larger hotels, such as full-service, branded, or luxury hotels, are subject to more tax obligations than smaller inns or single-room rentals.
