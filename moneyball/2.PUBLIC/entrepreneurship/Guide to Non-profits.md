# Forms You Can Access to Read Nonprofits

You can access several key forms and filings to review information about nonprofit organizations:

**IRS Forms:**

- **Form 990, 990-EZ, 990-PF, 990-N:** These are annual information returns that most tax-exempt nonprofits must file with the IRS. They provide details on a nonprofit’s finances, governance, and activities. These forms are publicly available and can be accessed via the IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search (TEOS), Candid’s 990 Finder, and GuideStar[](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-public-disclosure-obtaining-copies-of-documents-from-irs)
