|Approach/Model|Energy Efficiency Gain|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Small, task-specific models|High|Used for simple queries, much less energy|
|Neuromorphic/brain-inspired AI|Orders of magnitude lower|Early stage, promising results|
|CRAM hardware|Up to 1,000x reduction|Experimental, not yet mainstream|
|Efficient large models|10–40x less energy|Commercial models with validated claims|
|Power-capped GPU training|12–15% reduction|Minimal performance trade-off|
|Low-power AI hardware suites|Focus on low-power operation|Used in cellular networks and edge AI|
