## theory
What we can see and who we can interact is the most importnat resource.  With it we can hone skills.

- THINK OF everything in square footage.
	- Repair-> Hardest!
	- Occupancy
	- Flip, Rental, short term stay, etc.


## Ryan Angle (Mcdonalds Approach)
Think of zoning and why, who what.  I want to be a creepy salesman.  Like do research call X up and be like yo you need this land, I know x, y and z about your business and this commercial y; or it could easily be rezoned.

However to get everything we can it's how much is the cost of repair.  No way to fake this.  But we cut everything on the menu that doesn't sell, keep burgers and french fries.  We care about undervalue in [inspections](#inspection).  This is cheap to repair to price.

### money to made in rezoning
This is a long game of interacting with alot of counties, and organizations, and mapping culture opposing that to town hall.

don't want to worry about [[building permits]]

Before construction can begin, [your contractor](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/home-improvement/when-homeowners-must-obtain-permits-for-home-projects.html) will contact your municipal office and discuss your plans. They’ll know what permits are necessary, and they might already have a relationship with the municipality, which could help speed up the process.
