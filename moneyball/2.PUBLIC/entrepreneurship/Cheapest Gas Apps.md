# gas contracts
- **Fuel Contracting Programs:** Companies like MFA Oil allow you to lock in a fixed price for gasoline or diesel for up to 12 months, protecting you from market price spikes. There are also maximum price contracts, which set a ceiling but allow you to benefit if prices fall[2](https://www.mfaoil.com/fuels/fuel-contracting/).
    
- **Bulk and Wholesale Fuel Contracts:** Providers such as Go Energies, Zelawar Fuel Services, Foster Fuels, and Shipley Energy offer bulk fuel at wholesale rates. These contracts often include flexible delivery, inventory management, and personalized pricing. Some guarantee prices that beat state contracts or offer volume discounts for large orders[3](https://www.goenergies.com/wholesale-fuel)[4](https://zelawar.com/wholesale-contract.php)[5](https://fosterfuels.com/products-services/transportation-bulk-fuel/)[7](https://www.shipleyenergy.com/commercial/transport-trucking/).
