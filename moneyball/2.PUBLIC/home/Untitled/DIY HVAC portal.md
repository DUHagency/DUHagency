# Everything You Need to Hook Up HVAC to a Home (2025)

# 1. Core HVAC System Components

- **Heating Unit:** Furnace (gas, electric, or oil), or heat pump (increasingly common and required to meet new standards).
    
- **Cooling Unit:** Central air conditioner or heat pump.
    
- **Air Handler/Blower:** Circulates air through the system.
    
- **Ductwork:** Supply and return ducts for distributing conditioned air.
    
- **Thermostat:** Smart or programmable, required by code for energy efficiency.
    
- **Vents and Registers:** For air distribution in each room.
    
- **Refrigerant Lines:** Copper tubing connecting outdoor and indoor units.
    
- **Condensate Drain Line:** Removes moisture from the system.
    
- **Electrical Connections:** Dedicated circuits and disconnects for HVAC.

# 2. New 2025 HVAC Regulations

- **Refrigerant:** All new residential air conditioners and heat pumps must use A2L refrigerants (such as R-454B or R-32), which have a lower global warming potential. Older refrigerants like R-410A are being phased out, and new systems must be compliant starting January 1, 2025[1](https://trustacree.com/blog/new-hvac-regulations-2025/)[2](https://www.hvac.com/expert-advice/2023-hvac-regulations/)[3](https://www.lennox.com/residential/lennox-life/consumer/new-hvac-refrigerant-2025).
    
- **Efficiency Standards:** Systems must meet higher SEER2 (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings, which are stricter than previous SEER requirements. Minimums have increased nationwide, making new units more energy-efficient[4](https://www.boomandbucket.com/blog/new-construction-hvac)[6](https://www.totalair.com/commercial/hvac/maintenance/new-hvac-law-2025/)[7](https://www.sanksmechanical.com/regulations-for-installing-new-hvac-systems-starting-in-2025/).
    
- **Heat Pump Ready:** New builds must include a dedicated 240V circuit for future heat pump installation, even if a gas furnace is initially installed[5](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/2025_Residential_Mandatory_Measures_Summary_ADA.pdf).
    
- **Smart Thermostats:** Required for most new systems to maximize efficiency and meet code requirements[5](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/2025_Residential_Mandatory_Measures_Summary_ADA.pdf).
    
- **Proper Insulation and Duct Sealing:** To meet energy codes and ensure efficiency[4](https://www.boomandbucket.com/blog/new-construction-hvac)[5](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/2025_Residential_Mandatory_Measures_Summary_ADA.pdf).
    
- **Certified Equipment:** All HVAC equipment must be certified to meet federal and state energy standards[5](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/2025_Residential_Mandatory_Measures_Summary_ADA.pdf).

# 3. Additional Required Elements

- **Ventilation:** Mechanical ventilation (HRV/ERV) for fresh air and humidity control, meeting ASHRAE 62.2 standards[4](https://www.boomandbucket.com/blog/new-construction-hvac).
    
- **Air Filtration:** MERV-rated filters or higher for improved indoor air quality.
    
- **Surge Protection:** For sensitive electronic components.
    
- **Condensate Pump:** If gravity drainage is not possible.
    
- **Pad or Mounting Bracket:** For outdoor condenser unit.

# 4. Installation and Compliance

- **Manual J, S, and D Calculations:** For proper system sizing, equipment selection, and duct design[4](https://www.boomandbucket.com/blog/new-construction-hvac).
    
- **Permits and Inspections:** Required to ensure code compliance and safe operation.
    
- **Licensed HVAC Contractor:** Professional installation is essential for safety, warranty, and efficiency.

# 5. Modern Upgrades (2025)

- **Variable-speed compressors and blowers**
    
- **Zoned HVAC systems** for room-by-room control
    
- **Integrated smart home controls**
    
- **Ductless mini-split systems** for additions or specific rooms

|Central AC/Heat Pump|Same as above|
|Ductwork|Properly sized/sealed; insulated to code|
|Thermostat|Smart/programmable required|
|Ventilation (HRV/ERV)|Required for fresh air, humidity control (ASHRAE 62.2)|
|Electrical|Dedicated circuits, exterior disconnect, surge protection|
|Refrigerant Lines|Compatible with A2L refrigerants|
|Permits/Inspections|Mandatory for code compliance|
|Air Filtration|MERV-rated or higher|
|Heat Pump Ready Circuit|Dedicated 240V circuit for future upgrades|
