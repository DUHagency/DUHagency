# characteristics of living organisms[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#characteristics_of_living_organisms)

- cells
- energy
- homeostasis
- DNA, RNA and protein
- reproduction
- evolution

## Cell theory[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#Cell_theory)

all living organisms are composed of one or more cells  
cells are the smallest units of life  
new cells come only from pre-exists cells by cell division

### Cell Theory (or Cell Doctrine)[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#Cell_Theory_or_Cell_Doctrine_)

# Homeostasis[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#Homeostasis)

is the maintaining of a relatively stable internal physiological environment in an organism  
all living things maintain relatively stable internal environments  
examples in humans include pH, temperature, and blood pressure

An autotroph is an organism that can make its own food  
A heterotroph is an organism that can’t make its own food and must obtain it from another organism.

# dna, rna, protein[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#dna_rna_protein)

- All organisms use Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), Ribonucleic Acid (RNA), and proteins:
- All organisms use Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) as their genetic material
- RNA, among other things, is involved in expressing the information stored in DNA
- Proteins perform many of the functions of cells and organisms

In transcription the nucleotide sequence in DNA determines the nucleotide sequence of the RNA through the base pairing rules.  
In translation the nucleotide sequence in RNA determines the amino acid sequence of the protein using tRNAs.

Gene – a segment of DNA that codes for a protein or codes for a RNA molecule that is not mRNA.

# energy[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#energy)

All organisms require energy

They must acquire, transform, and use energy

The ultimate source of energy for most organisms is the sun

- Acquiring energy: The ultimate source of energy for most organisms is the sun. Some organisms acquire that energy directly, like plants, while others will acquire it indirectly, like animals can do by eating plants or eating other animals that eat plants.
- Transforming energy: Organisms are constantly transforming one form of energy into another and their existence depends on it. Energy has to be transformed into forms that are usable by the organism. Two important energy transforming pathways that we will discuss in mind numbing detail are photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration. [Photosynthesis](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=Photosynthesis) transforms light energy (a form of kinetic energy) into food (a form of chemical energy) for a plant. Aerobic cellular respiration transforms food (a form of chemical energy) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is also chemical energy, but it is a form that cells use directly to power various processes.
- Using Energy: All organisms expend energy. Everything an organism spends its energy on depends on the organism, but all organisms will spend energy on maintaining a constant and organized internal environment, synthesizing the many molecules that perform the functions of cells, and reproducing.

  
all living organisms reproduce  
during reproduction DNA is transmitted from parent to offspring  
two main types: asexual and sexual

# reproduction[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#reproduction)

all living organisms reproduce

during reproduction DNA is transmitted from parent to offspring

two main types: asexual and sexual

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|reproduction|asexual|sexual|   |
|How many parents are involved?|It involves one parent giving rise to the offspring.|It involves two parents giving rise to the offspring.|   |
|What do the offspring look like genetically (DNA) compared to the parent(s)?|The offspring are usually genetically identical to the parent.|The offspring are not genetically identical to either parent.|The offspring are not genetically identical to either parent.|

# Evolution[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=chapter-1#Evolution)

Evolution is a population of organisms (not an individual) changing over time

Natural Selection is the most important cause of evolution  
all organisms on earth share a common ancestry
