## Public Libraries

- Libraries commonly offer meeting rooms, auditoriums, and event spaces for public use, often free or at low cost.
    
- Spaces vary in sizeâ€”from small meeting rooms (30-50 capacity) to large auditoriums (100+ capacity).
    
- Libraries host diverse events: author readings, book clubs, workshops, community discussions, cultural events, and educational programs.
    
- Many libraries require event organizers to sign agreements, follow policies, and sometimes pay fees unless waived for community or partner organizations.
    
- Libraries often provide A/V equipment, seating arrangements, and support staff for events.
    
- Examples: Columbus Metropolitan Library, St. Charles City-County Library, Schaumburg Township District Library[](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Private_Events.pdf)
