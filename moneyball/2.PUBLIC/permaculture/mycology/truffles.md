- can you get these anywhere else lol
- truffles have been successfully cultivated outside their natural range by manually inoculating suitable host trees and establishing truffle orchards in new regions. This has been achieved in various parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, and more[3](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/perigord-black-truffle-cultivated-in-the-uk-for-the-first-time)[5](https://trufflegrowers.com/resources/faq/)[8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMXiYKZM_6w).

For example, the Périgord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum), native to the Mediterranean, was cultivated in the UK for the first time, attributed to both careful orchard management and changing climatic conditions[3](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/perigord-black-truffle-cultivated-in-the-uk-for-the-first-time). In North America, truffle orchards have been established in states like California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, Oklahoma, and Idaho by controlling soil chemistry, irrigation, and using inoculated trees[2](https://sabatino1911.com/blogs/trufflepedia/what-land-can-grow-truffles)[5](https://trufflegrowers.com/resources/faq/). Truffle growers and researchers emphasize that with the right soil (especially proper pH and drainage), climate, and tree species, truffle cultivation is possible well outside traditional European truffle regions[5](https://trufflegrowers.com/resources/faq/)[8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMXiYKZM_6w).

These successes demonstrate that, with careful site selection, soil preparation, and ongoing orchard management, truffles can be grown in many places beyond their native habitats by inoculating trees and creating the right conditions[5](https://trufflegrowers.com/resources/faq/)[8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMXiYKZM_6w)[3](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/perigord-black-truffle-cultivated-in-the-uk-for-the-first-time).
