Wine cap  
Fresh $10-$25 a lb  
Dryed $30-$60 a lb

Culture  
Making a wine cap mushroom culture involves propagating a small amount of mycelium from a mature mushroom onto a sterile growth medium, such as agar or grain. This process can be done using either spores or tissue samples from a mature mushroom. Here are the general steps for making a wine cap mushroom culture:  
Materials:  
Mature wine cap mushroom  
Sterile work area  
Sterile scalpel or razor blade  
Sterile gloves  
Agar or grain growth medium  
Petri dishes or glass jars with lids  
Pressure cooker or other sterilization equipment  
Steps:  
Prepare the growth medium: If using agar, sterilize it in a pressure cooker or other sterilization equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pour the agar into sterile Petri dishes or glass jars with lids. If using grain, sterilize it in a pressure cooker or other sterilization equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow the grain to cool to room temperature.  
Prepare the mushroom sample: Use a sterile scalpel or razor blade to cut a small piece of tissue from the mushroom, making sure to avoid any visible contamination. Alternatively, you can collect spores from a mature mushroom by placing it on a sterile surface and covering it with a glass or plastic container for several hours. The spores will fall onto the surface and can be collected with a sterile tool.  
Inoculate the growth medium: If using a tissue sample, place it onto the center of an agar plate or mix it with the sterilized grain. If using spores, sprinkle them onto the agar or grain. Seal the Petri dishes or jars with lids.  
Incubate the culture: Keep the Petri dishes or jars in a warm, dark location for several days to allow the mycelium to grow. If using agar, check the dishes regularly for signs of contamination, such as mold or bacteria. If using grain, shake the jars occasionally to distribute the mycelium.  
Use the culture: Once the mycelium has fully colonized the growth medium, it can be used to inoculate a wine cap mushroom bed or to make more cultures. Simply transfer a small amount of the mycelium onto a prepared bed of soil and organic matter, or onto a fresh batch of agar or grain.  
Making a wine cap mushroom culture requires careful attention to sterile technique and a few specialized tools, but it can be a rewarding process for mushroom growers. With a little bit of practice, you can propagate your own wine cap mushroom cultures and grow your own delicious mushrooms at home.

Storage  
If you have made a wine cap mushroom culture and want to store it for future use, there are several options depending on how long you need to keep it and how you plan to use it. Here are some general guidelines for storing a wine cap mushroom culture:  
Short-term storage:  
If you plan to use the culture within a few days or weeks, you can store it in the refrigerator. Wrap the Petri dish or jar tightly in plastic wrap to prevent contamination, then place it in a plastic bag or container in the refrigerator. Check the culture regularly for signs of contamination.  
Medium-term storage:  
If you need to store the culture for several months or up to a year, you can transfer it to a fresh growth medium and seal it in a sterile container. Use a sterile scalpel or razor blade to transfer a small amount of the mycelium onto a fresh agar plate or sterilized grain. Seal the container tightly and store it in a cool, dark location.  
Long-term storage:  
If you need to store the culture for several years or longer, you can freeze it in a cryovial or other sterile container. Use a sterile scalpel or razor blade to transfer a small amount of the mycelium onto a fresh agar plate or sterilized grain. Allow the mycelium to fully colonize the growth medium, then transfer it to a cryovial or other sterile container. Add a cryoprotectant such as glycerol or DMSO to the container to protect the mycelium during freezing. Seal the container tightly and freeze it at -80Â°C.  
It is important to note that even with proper storage techniques, cultures can still become contaminated or lose viability over time. It is a good practice to periodically transfer cultures to fresh growth medium to maintain their health and vigor.

Spawn  
Making wine cap mushroom spawn at home requires a few key ingredients and tools, but it can be a fun and rewarding process. Here is a general overview of how to make wine cap mushroom spawn:  
Materials:  
Wine cap mushroom spores or a wine cap mushroom culture  
Organic substrate such as sawdust, wood chips, or straw  
Grain spawn such as rye, wheat, or millet  
Large pot or pressure cooker  
Glass jars with lids  
Sterile gloves  
Spray bottle filled with water  
Work area that has been cleaned and disinfected  
Steps:  
Sterilize the substrate: If you are using sawdust, soak it in water overnight to hydrate it. Drain off the excess water, then sterilize the substrate in a large pot or pressure cooker. This will kill off any bacteria or other microorganisms that could compete with the mushroom mycelium. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for sterilization times and temperatures.  
Prepare the grain spawn: Rinse the grain thoroughly and soak it in water for 8-12 hours. Drain off the water, then sterilize the grain in a large pot or pressure cooker. Let the grain cool, then mix in the wine cap mushroom spores or culture. Allow the spores or culture to colonize the grain for several weeks, shaking the jars periodically to distribute the mycelium.  
Mix the spawn with the substrate: Once the grain spawn has been fully colonized, mix it with the sterilized substrate in a clean, sterile work area. Use sterile gloves to avoid contaminating the spawn. Mix the spawn and substrate thoroughly, then transfer the mixture to glass jars with tight-fitting lids.  
Incubate the spawn: Keep the jars in a warm, dark location for several weeks to allow the mycelium to fully colonize the substrate. Shake the jars occasionally to distribute the mycelium.  
Use the spawn: Once the spawn has fully colonized the substrate, it can be used to inoculate a wine cap mushroom bed. Simply spread the spawn over a prepared bed of soil and organic matter, then cover it with a layer of mulch or straw. Water the bed regularly to keep it moist, and wait for the mushrooms to grow.  
Making wine cap mushroom spawn at home requires careful attention to sterile technique and a few specialized tools, but it can be a fun and rewarding process. With a little bit of practice, you can grow your own wine cap mushrooms from scratch.

Growing Out  
Here is a general overview of how to grow wine cap mushrooms:  
Choose a suitable growing area: Wine cap mushrooms can be grown outdoors in a variety of settings, such as in a garden bed, on a patch of lawn, or in a raised bed. Choose a location that receives partial to full sun, has well-draining soil, and is protected from extreme heat and cold.  
Prepare the soil: Add a layer of organic material such as straw, leaves, or wood chips to the soil to create a moist, nutrient-rich bed for the mushrooms to grow in. Wine caps grow well in soil that has a pH range of 6-7.  
Inoculate the bed: Wine caps can be propagated by using spawn, which is a material that has been infused with the mushroom's mycelium (the fungal network that produces mushrooms). You can purchase spawn from a reputable supplier or create your own by mixing sawdust, wood chips, and spawn in a container and letting it colonize for several weeks. Once you have the spawn, scatter it over the prepared bed and mix it in with the soil.  
Water the bed: Water the bed thoroughly to ensure that the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Wine cap mushrooms prefer a moist environment with plenty of oxygen.  
Maintain the bed: Keep the bed moist by watering it regularly, and add a layer of mulch or organic material as needed to retain moisture. Wine cap mushrooms can produce fruiting bodies in as little as 6-8 weeks, and they will continue to produce mushrooms for several months. Harvest the mushrooms when they are fully mature but before they start to turn brown.  
Growing wine cap mushrooms is a relatively simple and rewarding process, and with a little bit of care and attention, you can enjoy a bountiful harvest of delicious, nutritious mushrooms right in your own backyard.
