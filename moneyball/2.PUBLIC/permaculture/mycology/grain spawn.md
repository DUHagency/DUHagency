Rye: Considered the gold standard for grain spawn. It hydrates well, holds moisture effectively, and is loved by almost all mushroom species- .
- Wheat berries: Perform similarly to rye and can be prepared using the same method. They hold less water than rye and are more likely to break when processed
- Millet: Excellent for mushroom spawn. It's the smallest grain and provides many inoculation points in the substrate
- Sorghum: Commonly used by commercial growers due to its availability and cost-effectiveness
- Barley: Can be used, though it's not ideal as it tends to become mushy and wet
- A blend of grains: Some producers use a proprietary blend, such as wheat seeds with a 10% sawdust-based supplement
