## Bay Bolete Mushroom

Boletes are mycorrhizal mushrooms. This means they associate with host trees that provide them with energy rich sugars in exchange for minerals, water, and other services. This is why boletes only grow in forests or woodlands!

The most common hosts for King Boletes are pines or other coniferous trees. In fact, research on this subject has suggested that in North America all the hosts of King Boletes and the related species are coniferous trees. While many mushroom hunters have claimed finding them under Oak, this is highly debated by some lead researchers on this subject. Other coniferous hosts include Fir (Abies), Douglas Fir (Psuedotsuga), and Spruce (Picea).

While it’s debated whether “Kings” really associate with Oak, many other types of boletes do associate with Oak. This includes many of the most exotic and unique boletes! A group of edile boletoid mushrooms in the genus Leccinum also associate with unique hosts. These include trees like Birch, Aspen, Manzanitas, and Madrones. These unique and specialized relationships are what give merit to the common names of “Birch Bolete” “Aspen Bolete” and “Manzanita Bolete” for said species.
