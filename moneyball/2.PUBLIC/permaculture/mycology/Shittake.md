Yes, different types of wood can impart slightly different flavors to the shiitake mushrooms grown on them. For example, oak logs can produce shiitake mushrooms with a slightly nutty or smoky flavor, while sweetgum logs can produce shiitake mushrooms with a slightly sweet taste. However, these flavor profiles are generally subtle and can be difficult to discern, and many other factors such as the strain of shiitake and growing conditions can also influence the taste of the mushrooms.
