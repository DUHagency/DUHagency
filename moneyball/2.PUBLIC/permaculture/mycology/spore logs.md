# Making sporeÂ plugs[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=spore-logs#Making_spore_plugs)

Making your own spore plugs is a fairly simple process that requires a few basic materials and tools. Here are the steps to make spore plugs:  
Materials needed:  
Freshly cut hardwood logs or branches (oak, maple, birch, etc.)  
Mushroom spawn (preferably in sawdust form)  
Beeswax or food-grade wax  
Drill with a 5/16-inch drill bit  
Wax melting pot or double boiler  
Spoon or ladle for wax

## Steps:[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=spore-logs#Steps:)

Collect freshly cut hardwood logs or branches from a healthy tree. Avoid using softwoods or diseased trees, as they may not be suitable for mushroom growth.  
Cut the logs or branches into 4-6 inch lengths, and allow them to dry for several days.  
Using a 5/16-inch drill bit, drill holes into the logs or branches. The holes should be about 1-2 inches deep and spaced about 6 inches apart.  
Fill the holes with mushroom spawn. You can use sawdust spawn, which is easier to work with or plug spawn, which is already in the shape of small dowels that fit perfectly into the holes. If using sawdust spawn, mix it with water to form a paste before filling the holes.  
Melt the beeswax or food-grade wax in a wax melting pot or double boiler.  
Using a spoon or ladle, pour the melted wax over the spawn-filled holes, covering the top of the plugs completely.  
Allow the wax to cool and harden, and then store the spore plugs in a cool, dry place until ready to use.  
Your spore plugs are now ready to be used to inoculate logs or stumps for mushroom cultivation. Simply insert the plugs into pre-drilled holes in the logs or stumps, and wait for the mushrooms to grow.

Tree removal companies: If you contact a company that removes trees, they may be able to sell you the logs from the trees they cut down.  
Online marketplaces: Websites like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace may have listings for people selling white oak logs in your area.  
Woodworking or woodcraft stores: Some stores that cater to woodworkers or wood crafters may sell logs or be able to direct you to a supplier.  
Forestry or agricultural organizations: Some organizations that focus on forestry or agriculture may be able to connect you with a supplier of white oak logs.
