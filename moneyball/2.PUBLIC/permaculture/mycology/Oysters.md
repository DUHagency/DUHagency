Growing out  
Choose a suitable location: Oyster mushrooms can be grown outdoors in a shady, protected spot. Look for a location that receives indirect sunlight and is sheltered from strong winds.  
Select a growing substrate: Oyster mushrooms can grow on a variety of substrates, including straw, sawdust, coffee grounds, and cardboard. Straw is a popular choice and is readily available in many areas. You can purchase bags of sterilized straws or prepare your own by soaking and pasteurizing it.  
Inoculate the substrate: Once you have your substrate ready, you'll need to inoculate it with oyster mushroom spawn. You can purchase spawn online or from a local supplier. The easiest way to inoculate straw is to mix the spawn into a pasteurized substrate and then pack it into plastic bags or containers.  
Maintain the growing conditions: Oyster mushrooms require a high level of humidity and consistent moisture to grow successfully. You'll need to keep the substrate moist by misting it regularly or using a drip irrigation system. You can also cover the growing area with a layer of mulch or straw to help retain moisture.  
Harvest the mushrooms: Oyster mushrooms typically take 2-3 weeks to start fruiting. Once you see small mushroom caps forming, you can start harvesting them by twisting them gently off the substrate. Be sure to harvest them before the caps flatten out and turn up at the edges.  
Repeat the process: Oyster mushrooms can produce multiple flushes of mushrooms, so you can continue to harvest them for several weeks. After each flush, remove any remaining mushroom stems and add a fresh layer of substrate to the growing area to encourage further growth.
