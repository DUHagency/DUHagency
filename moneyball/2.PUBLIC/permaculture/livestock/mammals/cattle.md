## tree fodder/hay

Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is hardy, reslient, and produces some of the most rot resitant wood in the temperate climate while also offering high-protein fodder for animals with essentially the same nutrition as alfalfa.

Willow (Salix spp.) are a huge genera of trees that are highly adaptable and produce condensed tannins that have been shown to reduce some parasite loads in grazing sheep

  
Mulberry (Morus spp.) are fast growing, highly productive, and very palatable for all grazing animals, including mono-gastric (single stomach) pigs and poultry.

  
Poplars (Populus spp.) offers one of the most valuable fodder and shade specaise that can be quickly established in a silvopasture.
