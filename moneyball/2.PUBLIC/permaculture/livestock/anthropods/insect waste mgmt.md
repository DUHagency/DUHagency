Termites: Termites are notorious for consuming wood, but they can also feed on paper and cardboard. They have specialized digestive systems that allow them to break down cellulose, the main component of paper.

Silverfish: These small, silver-colored insects are commonly found in dark, damp areas such as basements and attics. They feed on a variety of starchy materials, including paper, cardboard, and book bindings.

Booklice: Despite their name, booklice are not actually lice but rather tiny insects that feed on mold and mildew found in damp, humid environments. They are often found in libraries and archives where they may feed on paper.

Cockroaches: Certain species of cockroaches, such as the German cockroach, may feed on paper and cardboard in addition to other organic materials. They are attracted to areas with food and moisture.

Moths: Some species of moths, particularly those in the family Tineidae, are known as fabric or clothes moths because they feed on textiles. However, they may also feed on paper and paper-based materials.
