#permaculture 
There are many crops that can tolerate shade and still produce a good harvest. Here are some of the best shade-tolerant crops:  
Root vegetables: Root crops such as radishes, carrots, potatoes, and beets can grow in as little as 3-4 hours of direct sun with light or dappled shade for the rest of the day12.  
Leafy greens: Leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula, kale, bok choy, and chard are happy with just a few hours of sunshine each day12.  
Cruciferous vegetables: Broccoli and kale can grow well in partial shade conditions where they see closer to 6 hours of direct sun3.
