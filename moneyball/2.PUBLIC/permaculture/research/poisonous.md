Holly berries. These tiny berries contain the toxic compound saponin, which may cause nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps (51Trusted Source).  
Mistletoe. This popular Christmas plant has white berries that contain the toxic compound phoratoxin. It can cause stomach issues and a slow heartbeat (bradycardia), as well as brain, kidney, and adrenal gland toxicity (51Trusted Source).  
Jerusalem cherries. Also known as Christmas orange, this plant has yellow-red berries that contain solanine, a compound that can cause gastrointestinal infections, stomach cramping, and an irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) (51Trusted Source).  
Bittersweet. Also called woody nightshade, berries from this plant contain solanine. Theyâ€™re similar to Jerusalem cherries and can cause similar side effects (51Trusted Source).  
Pokeweed berries. These purple berries look like grapes but contain toxic compounds in the roots, leaves, stem, and fruit. This plant tends to get more toxic as it matures, and eating the berries is potentially fatal (52).  
Ivy berries. Purple-black to orange-yellow in color, these berries contain the toxin saponin. They may cause nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps (53).  
Yew berries. These bright red berries contain potentially toxic seeds. One study showed that eating too many yew seeds caused seizures (53).  
Virginia creeper berries. These climbing vine berries contain toxic amounts of calcium oxalate. Consuming too much of this compound can have toxic effects on your kidneys (54).
