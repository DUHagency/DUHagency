# how we manage our apples
## the hardiest of the hardy survive

Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis): This fungal disease affects leaves, fruit, and twigs, causing dark, scaly lesions on the surface.

Fire Blight (Erwinia amylovora): This bacterial disease can cause wilting, blackening, and a "burned" appearance of branches, resembling fire damage.

Cedar Apple Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae): This disease involves both apple trees and Eastern red cedar trees. It causes rust-colored spots on leaves.

Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera spp.): A fungal disease that appears as a white powdery substance on the leaves.

Apple Maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella): While not a disease, it's worth mentioning this insect pest that can damage apples by tunneling inside the fruit.

Brown Rot (Monilinia fructicola): This fungal disease affects the fruit, causing brown, rotting spots.

### Cedar Rust
