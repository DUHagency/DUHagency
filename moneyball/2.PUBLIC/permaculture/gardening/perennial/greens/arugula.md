Is Wild Arugula a Perennial Plant?

Yes, wild arugula is a perennial plant. It belongs to the Diplotaxis genus and is composed of two species: Diplotaxis tenuifolia and Diplotaxis erucoides. Wild arugula has the advantage of not bolting when exposed to hot weather, making it a desirable choice for gardeners in warm climates. In addition, the plant grows back year after year, providing continuous harvest from the same bed or pot.
