Passiflora incarnata (Maypop): This is the hardiest species, surviving in USDA Zones 5-91. It can handle Ohioâ€™s winters well and will regrow each spring.  
Passiflora caerulea (Blue Passionflower): This species can survive winters in Zones 6-9, though it may need some protection in the coldest parts of Ohio23. It can die back in winter but often regrows from the roots.  
Passiflora lutea (Yellow Passionflower): While less common, this species can also survive in similar conditions to P. caerulea
