## disease
### Fungal Diseases

1. **Apple Scab**: Caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_, it creates dark, scabby lesions on leaves and fruit.
2. **Canker**: Leads to sunken, dead areas on the bark, often caused by fungi like _Neonectria_ spp2.
3. **Fire Blight**: A bacterial disease that causes branches to appear burnt and can spread rapidly.
4. **Powdery Mildew**: Appears as a white powdery coating on leaves and shoots, caused by _Podosphaera leucotricha_2.
5. **Rust**: Creates orange or yellow pustules on leaves and fruit, caused by fungi like _Gymnosporangium_ spp2.
6. **Sooty Blotch and Flyspeck**: Fungi cause dark blotches and speckles on the fruit, affecting appearance but not taste.

### Bacterial Diseases

1. **Fire Blight**: As mentioned, it's a severe bacterial infection that can spread quickly.
2. **Crown Gall**: Caused by _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_, it forms galls or tumors on the roots and lower trunk.

### Viral Diseases

1. **Apple Mosaic Virus**: Causes mottled leaves and can reduce fruit quality.
    
2. **Apple Scab Virus**: Leads to distorted leaves and fruit.
    

### Physiological Disorders

1. **Bitter Pit**: Caused by calcium deficiency, leading to small, brown, sunken spots on the fruit.
    
2. **Cork Spot**: Also related to calcium deficiency, causing brown, corky spots on the fruit.
## pest
1. **Aphids**: These small insects can cause distorted growth and leave behind a sticky residue called honeydew, which can attract other pests.
2. **Apple Maggots**: The larvae of these flies burrow into the fruit, causing it to rot.
3. **Blister Mites**: These tiny mites cause blister-like formations on the fruit.
4. **Codling Moths**: The larvae of these moths burrow into the fruit, making it inedible.
5. **Leafhoppers**: These insects suck the sap from leaves, causing them to curl and distort.
6. **Scale Insects**: These pests attach themselves to the tree and suck sap, weakening the tree.
7. **Spider Mites**: These tiny mites can cause leaves to turn yellow and drop prematurely.
8. **Tent Caterpillars**: These caterpillars create large, web-like tents in the branches and can defoliate the tree.
9. **Thrips**: These slender insects can cause white scarring on the fruit and leaves.
10. **Woolly Apple Aphids**: These aphids create a woolly coating on branches and roots, which can lead to galls and weaken the tree.
11. **Borers**: These insects, such as the flat headed borer, lay eggs in the bark, and the larvae tunnel into the tree, causing internal damage.
12. **San Jose Scale**: These tiny insects feed on the bark sap and can cause deformities in the fruit and branches.
13. **Plum Curculio**: This beetle lays eggs in the fruit, and the larvae feed inside, causing damage.
## moisture tolerance
40 days + during growing season.
## cold and cool tolerance
Apples can be subarctic sustainable (zone fucking 2).
