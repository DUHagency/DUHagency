Cherries belong to the genus _Prunus_ and include a wide variety of species and cultivars used for fruit, ornamental purposes, and timber. The main types of cherries fall into two broad categories based on their fruit use and characteristics:

# 1. Sweet Cherries (Prunus avium)

- **Description:** Large, firm, heart-shaped fruit that are sweet and eaten fresh.
    
- **Uses:** Fresh eating, desserts, and some cooking.
    
- **Examples:** Bing, Rainier, Lambert, Chelan.
    
- **Climate:** Prefer milder winters, generally hardy to USDA zones 5-7.
    
- **Notes:** Sweet cherries are often self-sterile and require cross-pollination.
    

# 2. Sour (Tart) Cherries (Prunus cerasus)

- **Description:** Smaller, softer, more acidic fruit than sweet cherries.
    
- **Uses:** Cooking, baking (pies, jams), and preserves.
    
- **Examples:** Montmorency, Morello, Balaton.
    
- **Climate:** More cold-hardy than sweet cherries, suitable for USDA zones 4-7.
    
- **Notes:** Sour cherries are often self-fertile and easier to grow in colder climates.
    

# Other Notable Cherry Types and Species

|Type|Species or Group|Description & Use|Hardiness & Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Bird Cherries**|_Prunus padus_ and relatives|Small, sour fruits mostly eaten by birds; ornamental and wildlife value|Native to temperate Northern Hemisphere; not widely cultivated for fruit|
|**Black Cherry**|_Prunus serotina_|Wild cherry with small, dark fruit; wood valuable for timber|Native to North America; fruit edible but tart|
|**Nanking Cherry**|_Prunus tomentosa_|Small, tart fruit; used in jams and jellies|Very cold-hardy, good for northern climates|
|**Cherry Laurels**|_Prunus laurocerasus_|Evergreen shrubs/trees, ornamental; fruit not typically eaten|Used mainly for landscaping|
|**Hawthorn Cherries**|Various _Crataegus_ species|Small fruit, sometimes called cherries but botanically different|Mostly ornamental or wildlife food|

# Summary Table of Common Cherry Types

|Cherry Type|Species (Scientific Name)|Primary Use|USDA Hardiness Zone|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet Cherry|_Prunus avium_|Fresh eating|5-7|Requires cross-pollination|
|Sour Cherry|_Prunus cerasus_|Cooking, preserves|4-7|Often self-fertile|
|Black Cherry|_Prunus serotina_|Wild fruit, timber|3-7|Native, fruit tart|
|Nanking Cherry|_Prunus tomentosa_|Jams, jellies|3-6|Very cold-hardy|
|Bird Cherry|_Prunus padus_|Ornamental, wildlife|3-7|Small sour fruit|
|Cherry Laurel|_Prunus laurocerasus_|Ornamental|6-8|Not typically edible|

# Key Points:

- The **two most important fruiting cherries** are the **sweet cherry (Prunus avium)** and the **sour cherry (Prunus cerasus)**.
    
- **Sour cherries** are generally more cold-hardy and better adapted to colder climates.
    
- Other species like **Nanking cherry** and **black cherry** are used regionally for food or timber.
    
- Many cherries also have ornamental value, especially species with attractive flowers or evergreen leaves.
    

This classification covers the main types of cherries you’ll encounter for fruit production and landscaping.
