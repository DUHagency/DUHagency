In the United States, sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas), especially those with orange flesh, are often referred to as "yams"[5](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/5)[6](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/6)  
In Australia, the tubers of the Microseris lanceolata, or yam daisy, were a staple food of Aboriginal Australians in some regions.[7](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/7)  
In New Zealand, oca (Oxalis tuberosa) is typically referred to as "yam".[8](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/8)[9](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/9)  
In Malaysia and Singapore, taro (Colocasia esculenta) is referred to as "yam".[10](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/10)  
In Africa, South and Southeast Asia as well as the tropical Pacific islands Amorphophallus paeoniifolius is grown and known as "elephant foot yam".[11](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/11)

Yams are native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas.[1](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/1) Three species were independently domesticated on those continents: D. rotundata (Africa), D. alata (Asia), and D. trifida (South America).[12](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/12)
