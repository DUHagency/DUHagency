**Indoor Lighting for Growing Food**
- **Full-spectrum LED grow lights** are considered the best for indoor food production because they closely mimic natural sunlight and provide the wavelengths needed for both vegetative growth and fruiting[7](https://www.sylvane.com/what-color-light-is-the-best-for-growing-plants.html).
- **Duration:** Most edible plants need **12–16 hours of light per day**, with a rest period of at least 8 hours of darkness[2](https://www.lovethatleaf.co.nz/blogs/plant-care-guides/ultimate-grow-light-guide-indoor-plants)[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/114ovmd/how_long_should_the_lights_be_on/). Avoid running lights 24/7, as plants require darkness to rest and for healthy growth[2](https://www.lovethatleaf.co.nz/blogs/plant-care-guides/ultimate-grow-light-guide-indoor-plants)[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/114ovmd/how_long_should_the_lights_be_on/).
- **Distance:** Keep grow lights about **6 inches** from the tops of your plants for optimal intensity, as light intensity drops sharply with distance[8](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/how-to-use-grow-lights/).
- **Temperature:** For plants under LEDs, maintain air temperatures around **25–29°C (77–84°F)** for optimal metabolism, as LEDs emit less heat than other lights[1](https://www.blackdogled.com/pages/lst)[5](https://ecothrive.co.uk/blogs/news/cultivating-light-loving-plants-indoors-with-led-grow-lights).
