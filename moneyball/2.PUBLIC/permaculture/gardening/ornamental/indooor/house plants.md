# best soilless
## Epiphytic and mounted plants

- **Succulents**: Some varieties can be grown in coarse materials like perlite or grit, though most still require some substrate[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/7r91ov/soilless_indoor_plants/).

## water plants
**Plants that grow in water:**

- **Pothos**: Extremely adaptable, grows quickly in water, and tolerates a range of lighting conditions[1](https://www.thespruce.com/houseplants-grown-in-water-4177520)[2](https://plantify.co.za/blogs/my-plant-decor/best-indoor-plants-to-grow-in-water).

- **Chinese Evergreen**: Can be grown upright in water, though it grows slower than in soil[2](https://plantify.co.za/blogs/my-plant-decor/best-indoor-plants-to-grow-in-water).
    
- **Coleus, English Ivy, Begonias, Fiddle Leaf Fig, Croton, Pancake Plant, Paperwhites**: All can be rooted and grown in water for extended periods[1](https://www.thespruce.com/houseplants-grown-in-water-4177520).


# best for low maintenance

## best low water
- **Snake Plant (Sansevieria):** Exceptionally drought-tolerant; water only when the soil is completely dry, sometimes as little as once a month[1](https://bloomboxclub.com/blogs/news/best-indoor-plants-that-release-oxygen)[3](https://nicksgardencenter.com/gardening-blog/boost-your-bedrooms-oxygen-levels-at-night-with-the-following-houseplants/)[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/3lfeq3/what_indoor_plants_produce_the_most_oxygen_and/).
    
- **ZZ Plant:** Extremely hardy, tolerates long dry spells, and can survive with infrequent watering[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/3lfeq3/what_indoor_plants_produce_the_most_oxygen_and/).
    
- **Aloe Vera:** Stores water in its leaves and can go weeks without watering[2](https://nurserylive.com/blogs/top-10-plants/top-10-highest-oxygen-producing-indoor-plants)[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/3lfeq3/what_indoor_plants_produce_the_most_oxygen_and/).
    
- **Cacti and many succulents:** Adapted to arid environments, requiring very little water and thriving with neglect[3](https://nicksgardencenter.com/gardening-blog/boost-your-bedrooms-oxygen-levels-at-night-with-the-following-houseplants/).
    
- **Pothos:** While it prefers some moisture, it can survive being watered only when it starts to wilt, making it very forgiving for forgetful owners[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/3lfeq3/what_indoor_plants_produce_the_most_oxygen_and/)[5](https://balconygardenweb.com/most-oxygen-producing-houseplants/).

**Key reasons these plants are ideal:**

- They have many existing cultivars and hybrids, indicating high genetic variability[1](https://www.gardendesign.com/houseplants/best-indoor.html)[6](https://www.gardenersworld.com/house-plants/25-of-the-best-house-plants-to-grow/).
    
- They are easy to propagate, so you can grow many seedlings and select for unique traits[1](https://www.gardendesign.com/houseplants/best-indoor.html)[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VICzivo_tc).
    
- Traits like variegation, leaf shape, and color are already diverse and can be further enhanced through breeding[1](https://www.gardendesign.com/houseplants/best-indoor.html)[6](https://www.gardenersworld.com/house-plants/25-of-the-best-house-plants-to-grow/).
