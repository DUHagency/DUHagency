# propagation
## grafting
- **Whip and Tongue Graft**: A common method where a piece of the desired apple variety (scion) is grafted onto a rootstock.
- **Cleft Graft**: Used for larger rootstock, where a wedge-shaped scion is inserted into a split in the rootstock.
- **Bark Graft**: Ideal for larger trees, involves placing the scion between the bark and wood of the rootstock.
## Layering
1. **Air Layering**: Involves wounding a branch and encouraging root growth while still attached to the parent plant.
2. **Ground Layering**: Bending a low branch to the ground, covering a portion with soil, and allowing it to root before severing from the parent plant.
## Budding
1. **T-Budding**: A single bud from the desired apple variety is inserted under the bark of the rootstock.
2. **Chip Budding**: Involves cutting a chip of wood and bark with a bud and placing it into a matching cut on the rootstock.
## Cuttings
1. **Hardwood Cuttings**: Taking dormant, woody cuttings during the winter and rooting them.
2. **Softwood Cuttings**: Using tender new growth cuttings taken in late spring or early summer for rooting.
## Seed Propagation

- While not typically used for commercial apple production due to genetic variability, apple seeds can be planted to grow new trees. The resulting trees may not produce fruit identical to the parent variety.
