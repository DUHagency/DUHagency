## per capita consumption

The earthy-tasting sugar beet is a popular root vegetable in many countries due to its hearty nature and versatility. Typically, beets are associated with the country of Russia since it is often used to make the delicious soup borscht. However, you might be surprised to find out that the country of France consumes the most beets per capita. France is followed by Germany, Turkey, and finally Russia in beet consumption per capita. Russia does beat all these countries in beet production. They produce almost 14% of the world’s beets. This equals about 34 million tons of beets!
