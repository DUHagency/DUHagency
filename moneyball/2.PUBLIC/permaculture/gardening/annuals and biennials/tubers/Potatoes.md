# diseases
Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans): Late blight is one of the most destructive diseases of potatoes. It affects both foliage and tubers, causing dark lesions on leaves, stems, and eventually rotting of tubers. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and can spread rapidly during periods of high humidity.

Early Blight (Alternaria solani): Early blight is another fungal disease that affects potato foliage. It causes dark brown lesions with concentric rings on leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.

Potato Scab (Streptomyces scabies): Potato scab is a bacterial disease that affects the skin of potatoes, causing raised, corky lesions. While it doesn't usually affect the flesh, severe scab infestations can lead to reduced marketability.

Potato Virus Y (PVY): Potato Virus Y is a viral disease that affects potato plants, causing symptoms such as yellowing, stunting, and leaf curling. It can also affect tuber quality and reduce yield.

Potato Virus X (PVX): Potato Virus X is another viral disease that affects potato plants, causing symptoms such as leaf mosaic, leaf curling, and stunted growth. Infected tubers may also show symptoms such as internal necrosis and discoloration.

Potato Cyst Nematode (Globodera spp. and Heterodera spp.): Potato cyst nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect potato roots, causing stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield. They can also weaken plants, making them more susceptible to other diseases.

Early Dying (Verticillium wilt): Early dying is a fungal disease caused by Verticillium species. It affects potato foliage, causing wilting, yellowing, and premature death of plants. It can be particularly damaging in areas with high soil moisture and poor drainage.

Blackleg (Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum): Blackleg is a bacterial disease that affects potato stems and tubers, causing dark, soft rotting. Infected plants may collapse and die prematurely, leading to reduced yield and quality.

# pests
Colorado Potato Beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata): Colorado potato beetles are perhaps the most well-known pests of potatoes. Both adults and larvae feed on potato foliage, causing defoliation and reducing yield.

Aphids: Aphids are small, sap-sucking insects that can infest potato plants, causing stunted growth, yellowing, and distortion of leaves. They can also transmit viruses to potato plants.

Potato Leafhoppers (Empoasca fabae): Potato leafhoppers are small, wedge-shaped insects that feed on potato foliage, causing yellowing, stunted growth, and leaf curling. They can also transmit diseases to potato plants.

Wireworms: Wireworms are the larval stage of click beetles and are soil-dwelling pests that feed on potato tubers, causing tunneling and damage. They can be particularly problematic in fields with a history of grassy weeds.

Nematodes: Various species of nematodes can infect potato roots, causing stunted growth, wilting, and reduced yield. Potato cyst nematodes are particularly damaging, as they can form cysts on roots and reduce plant vigor.

Tuber Moth (Phthorimaea operculella): Tuber moths are small, brown moths whose larvae tunnel into potato tubers, causing damage and reducing storage quality.

Potato Psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli): Potato psyllids are small insects that feed on potato foliage, causing yellowing, stunting, and leaf curling. They can also transmit a bacterial disease called zebra chip.

Mites: Spider mites and other mite species can infest potato plants, causing stippling, yellowing, and bronzing of foliage. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation and reduced yield.

Rodents: Rodents such as mice and voles can feed on potato tubers, causing damage and reducing storage quality. They can also burrow in soil, leading to mechanical damage to potato plants.
