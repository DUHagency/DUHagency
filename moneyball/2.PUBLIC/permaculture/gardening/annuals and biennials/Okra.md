### predators

The best way to control Aphids is to have lots of insectary plants around to feed their predators.  
Then grow okra that will attract ladybugs, hummingbirds, and green lacewings.  
These bugs and birds are the best at most effectively and quickly eating and getting rid of aphids.

Ladybugs and Lacewings are the best type of insects to eat and destroy aphid eggs and larvae.

Birds like chickadees are the best animal to attract to eat and destroy large numbers of adult aphids.

### insecticides and non bio

![link](https://thegardeningdad.com/10-best-insecticides-for-your-vegetable-garden/)  
use essential oils to get rid of aphids.  
Insecticidal Soap is a low-toxicity pesticide made of potassium and fatty acids that have been used by gardeners and farmers for centuries. It can kill large amounts of soft-shell insects like aphids without harming your plants, animals, or humans.

You can also make your own Insecticidal Soap by combining one cup of oil (peanut, vegetable, corn, etc.) with one tablespoon of dish soap. Do not use bleach.  
Use 4 to 5 drops of peppermint, clove, rosemary, and thyme and mix it with 1 cup of water. Spray onto the okra with aphids in the morning. You can also apply in the evening too.  
Repeat until the aphids are gone.

Then create your own organic pesticide. You can create it by doing either of the following:

Mix 3 teaspoons of dish soap with 1 quart of water. You can either spray or gently apply this solution onto your okra leaves

Mix 1 teaspoon of dish soap, 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and 1 quart of water.  
Apply a light dusting of diatomaceous earth. While not toxic to humans or animals, it can immediately kill aphids with it’s razor sharp particles.

Neem Oil

While you can make your own organic neem oil it is recommended to mix commercialal Neem Oil with water in a garden sprayer and apply it onto all your fruit and vegetable trees in mid to late winter immediately before the last frost.
