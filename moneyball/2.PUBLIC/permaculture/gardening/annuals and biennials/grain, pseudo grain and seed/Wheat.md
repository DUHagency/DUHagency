## Perennial Wheat: Research & Development

- **Perennial wheat** is being developed by hybridizing annual wheat species with perennial grasses such as intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium)[3](https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/resources/pdfs/perennial_wheat_\(e3208\).pdf)[2](https://landinstitute.org/our-work/perennial-crops/perennial-wheat/).
    
- These hybrids can regrow for multiple years after harvest, offering environmental benefits like reduced soil erosion and improved water quality[3](https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/resources/pdfs/perennial_wheat_\(e3208\).pdf)[2](https://landinstitute.org/our-work/perennial-crops/perennial-wheat/).
    
- Current elite lines of perennial wheat yield about 50–70% as much grain as annual wheat, and some plants have survived for up to nine years in field trials[2](https://landinstitute.org/our-work/perennial-crops/perennial-wheat/).
    
- Well-known perennial wheatgrass grains include **Kernza®**, which is a distant cousin of wheat and not a true wheat species, but is grown as a perennial grain crop[6](https://wholegrainscouncil.org/blog/2022/11/update-perennial-grains-wheatgrass-rice-and-sorghum).
    
- Most perennial wheat lines are still under developm
