he Indoor Focus  
Pineapple (Ananas comosus): Pineapple plants can sometimes produce fruit within a year when grown from the top of a mature fruit.  
Papaya (Carica papaya): Papaya trees are known for their relatively quick growth and can produce fruit within 6-12 months from seed.  
Banana (Musa spp.): While it's more common to propagate bananas from offsets (suckers), some banana varieties can produce fruit within a year from seed.  
Passion Fruit (Passiflora edulis): Passion fruit vines can sometimes bear fruit within a year if grown in optimal conditions.  
Guava (Psidium guajava): Guava trees can produce fruit in as little as 1-2 years from seed.  
Dragon Fruit (Hylocereus spp.): Dragon fruit cacti can potentially produce fruit within a year if they are provided with the right conditions.  
Pitaya (Stenocereus spp.): Similar to dragon fruit, some pitaya varieties may produce fruit relatively quickly.  
Lychee (Litchi chinensis): While it's uncommon, under ideal conditions, lychee trees may fruit within a year from seed.  
Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum): Rambutan trees may produce fruit within 1-2 years in optimal conditions.  
Cacao (Theobroma cacao): Cocoa trees can start producing cacao pods in 2-3 years from seed if grown in a tropical climate.

Papaya (Easy)  
'T.R. Hovey' Papaya: This is one of the smallest papaya varieties, often grown as a potted plant. 'T.R. Hovey' papaya plants typically reach heights of 3 to 5 feet and produce small fruit.  
'Papino' Papaya: 'Papino' is another miniature papaya variety known for its compact size. It usually grows to a height of around 3 to 4 feet and produces small to medium-sized fruit.  
'Calimosa' Papaya: 'Calimosa' papayas are smaller and more manageable than standard papaya trees. They typically reach heights of 4 to 5 feet and produce sweet and small to medium-sized fruit.

Mangos (Expert)  
Gomera-1 (Gomera-1): Mango trees on Gomera-1 rootstock are typically maintained at heights ranging from 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7 meters).  
Bappakai (Bappakai): Mango trees on Bappakai rootstock can be kept relatively small, often ranging from 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters).  
Amrapali (Amrapali): Mango trees on Amrapali rootstock may reach heights of 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.6 meters) with regular pruning.  
Dashehari (Dashehari): Mango trees on Dashehari rootstock can be maintained at heights between 8 to 15 feet (2.4 to 4.6 meters), depending on pruning and growing conditions.  
Vellaikolumban (Vellaikolumban): Trees on Vellaikolumban rootstock tend to have a more compact growth habit and may be maintained at heights around 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7 meters).

Banana (Master)  
Dwarf Cavendish Banana (Musa acuminata 'Dwarf Cavendish'): This is one of the most popular and widely grown dwarf banana varieties. It typically reaches a height of around 4 to 6 feet and can start producing fruit in as little as 9 to 12 months under suitable growing conditions. The fruit is similar in taste and appearance to the common Cavendish banana.  
Lady Finger Banana (Musa acuminata 'Lady Finger' or 'Pisang Mas'): Lady Finger bananas are smaller and sweeter than Cavendish bananas. They are known for their compact size and relatively quick fruiting, often taking about 12 to 15 months to produce fruit.  
Dwarf Red Banana (Musa acuminata 'Dwarf Red'): This dwarf banana variety produces small, sweet bananas with a reddish skin. It typically starts producing fruit in approximately 12 to 18 months.  
Raja Puri Banana (Musa acuminata 'Raja Puri'): Raja Puri bananas are known for their quick fruiting, typically producing fruit in 12 to 16 months. They have a sweet flavor and are often used in cooking.  
Apple Banana (Musa acuminata 'Apple' or 'Manzano'): Apple bananas are small and sweet, with a flavor reminiscent of apple and strawberry. They are known for their relatively fast fruiting, which can occur within 12 to 18 months.

!the  goal
A way for the community at large to participate in an agricultural research program ran by someone legit (OSU, USDA).  The name being some like "the small plot development program".  The mission of this organization will be to evelavate food insecurity and develop locally adapted disease resistant crops.
