**Multi-Strain Plants for Legal Compliance**
One final, interesting application of grafting cannabis, is creating plants that produce more than one strain. In locations where the number of plants you can legally grow is restricted, scions of multiple strains can be grafted onto a single plant, to provide variety, without increasing the plant count. Each branch of a plant could have a different strain grafted onto it. A grafted, multi-strain plant could be flowered to finish its life-cycle, and produce a multitude of different buds, or could be used as a mother plant, to produce clones of several different strains. Check with your local authorities to verify legal compliance.

**Summary**
Grafting has many compelling uses, and could play a major role in the future of the cannabis industry. Imparting pest and disease resistance, increasing yields, providing stability in high winds, improving drought tolerance, virus indexing, and growing multiple strains per plant, are all ways that grafting can be applied to cannabis production.
