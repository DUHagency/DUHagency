 [I Love Growing Marijuana](https://support.ilovegrowingmarijuana.com/)


The [THCFarmer](https://www.thcfarmer.com/forums/) forum grew out of the need for a place geared toward growers and people intimately involved in cannabis cultivation. Dubbing itself the Cannabis Cultivation Network, THCFarmer is a bright and easy-to-navigate forum that’s segmented into various marijuana-growing topics. 

One such section, Medical Cannabis Cultivation, leads site visitors through basic growing information, general indoor and outdoor growing tips, a rundown of the best nutrients and fertilizers, a “Breeder’s Lab” that discuss strains and hybrids, grow room design suggestions, lighting setups, grow diaries, concentrates and processing, and a section addressing advanced techniques and problems. 

There’s even a Cannabis Classifieds section where growers can sell or trade equipment, as well as a Cannabis Lifestyle section with industry news, cannabis recipes, general gardening advice, medical discussions, and more. 



Here’s another forum that gives growers and cultivators everything they need: [Rollitup](https://www.rollitup.org/) segments its forum into sections, such as The Grow Room, where community members discuss everything about indoor and outdoor growing, hydroponics, potential plant problems, organic efforts, and more. The Grow Room is a valuable resource, as it’s active, updated daily, and populated with hundreds of thousands of messages. 

Cannabis Cafe is another popular section on Rollitup; it’s where the discussions about cultivating marijuana grow into a diverse array of lifestyle topics. There’s the “Toke ‘n Talk” subforum, with community members sharing their cosmic insights on all manner of issues, along with subforums on fitness and wellbeing, music, sports, and even politics (proceed with caution in that particular subtopic). All in all, Rollitup is ideal for the serious grower that craves connections with cannabis believers. 

## 7. 420 Magazine

With tens of thousands of posts on hundreds of threads, [420 Magazine](https://www.420magazine.com/community/) boasts an active forum with some of the most friendly and helpful individual posters in any Internet community—that might sound like hyperbole but check it out for yourself. 

The Grow Room section specifically built for cannabis cultivation features chat rooms from the essentials (“How to Grow Marijuana”), to the complex (“Cultivation Scientific Data”), and everything in between. In addition, the “Grower’s Lounge” subtopic of The Green Room doubles as a support group for anyone having difficulty with an array of grower’s problems. Meanwhile, the forum’s “Frequently Asked Questions” subtopic (in the Grow Room) could be one of the Internet’s most valuable sources of cannabis cultivation information. 

## 8. Marijuana Growing

With a slightly smaller community than some other sites, [Marijuana Growing](http://www.marijuanagrowing.com/forumdisplay.php?9-Marijuana-Growing-Forums) is a tad more approachable and appealing to growers who might be new to the game. This is where to go when you want to conduct research rather than chat with other growers daily. The Marijuana Growing forum comes to us courtesy of George Van Patten, a horticulturist who literally wrote the book on the cultivation of cannabis: *Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower’s Bible*. You might know Van Patten better by his pseudonym, Jorge Cervantes, which he used to conceal his identity from 1983 to 2010. 

## 9. Grow Weed Easy

Founded by cannabis cultivation expert Nebula Haze and her partner Sirius in 2010, [Grow Weed Easy](https://forum.growweedeasy.com/forum/growing-community) is dedicated to teaching beginners how to grow cannabis at home. The forum presents cannabis cultivators and growers with an anonymous place to chat about their plants, discoveries, and problems with other growers. Community members ask questions, get advice, share photos, and discuss all topics relating to growing weed, as well as the cannabis lifestyle. 

## 10. Bluelight

While technically a subforum of a much larger community, the [Bluelight cannabis forum](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/forums/cannabis-discussion.70/) shines brightest when it comes to intelligent conversations surrounding basic and advanced cannabis-related topics. In nearly every topic, you’ll find well-informed discussions relating to the science of cannabis, with obscure details made more evident by the dogged research of the forum’s dedicated community members. An ideal place to dive into the data and analytics of the cannabis plant species, Bluelight serves up opportunities to dig deep into the emerging science of cultivation. 

## 11. THC Talk

Once you step into the [THC Talk forum](http://www.thctalk.com/cannabis-forum/index.php), you immediately recognize that this community is much more knowledgeable and goes deeper into the weeds than most other cannabis forums. While this can be intimidating, it’s precisely the characteristic that makes this forum such a dynamic place to learn about cannabis cultivation. There are sections about plant germination and propagation, composting, aspects of horticulture beyond cannabis, and more. The Cannabis Infirmary subtopic is especially helpful, with home-growing experts on call to help diagnose plant problems. There’s also an expertly compiled cannabis strain database, which takes this space beyond growing and cultivating.

## 12. IC Mag

International Cannagraphic Magazine, known mainly as [IC Mag](https://www.icmag.com/), features a moderately active community discussing an array of helpful topics, mainly surrounding their Cannabis Growing Questions subforum . A glance at the issues reveals an advanced list of fully defined cannabis-related terms, a post about LED lighting rigs, auto-watering systems, how to achieve great buds in cold weather, the optimal spacing for lights, and more. There’s even a topic where community members post photos of their favorite mutant plants they’ve ever grown. 

## 13. How To Grow Marijuana

It doesn’t get much more straightforward than a forum titled [How To Grow Marijuana](https://forum.howtogrowmarijuana.com/). This online community delivers a comprehensive menu of growing tips and tricks, with plenty of expertise on display for free. The Grow Room section presents topics from the basics of growing to the more advanced details straight from the weed horticulturist’s handbook. There’s extensive information on growing indoors with hydroponics, as well as how to grow marijuana organically, proper grow room setup, germination techniques, nutrients, harvesting, drying, and curing. Then there’s the ultra-useful Cannabis Clinic, where you can go for advice on treating sick plants.
Rollitup is one of the busiest grow forums that you can follow to soak in valuable growing information. With over 800,000 followers, the flow of information on the  [forum](https://weedmania420.com/growing/10-best-marijuana-grow-forums-in-2020/?form=MG0AV3#) is ceaseless— every minute, a question pops up, and an answer follows right back.

The issues discussed here are far and wide. From outdoor growing, indoor growing, hydroponics growing, organics, and potential plant issues, this forum can make an expert out of a novice grower. It also helps that the discussions are grouped into varied sections like; Marijuana News & Discussions, Medical Marijuana, and the Grow Room, making it easier to navigate the forum and get what you need quickly.
