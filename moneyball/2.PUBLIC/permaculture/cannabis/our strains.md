## needs

## indoor
We need to focus on home growers.  Meaning maybe people with kids, animals, etc.  When indoors they don't want foul odors.  They want something smaller ([[self-topping strains]]).  They're going to forget to give it the [[cannabis light cycling|proper light cycling]], [[humidity regulation]], [[fan speed]], [[air filtering]], [[Cannabis Nutrient Demands|nutrient demands]], etc. 
### traits of concern
1. [[self-topping strains|small and compact growth habit]]
2. [[non-smelly strains|low odor]]
3. [[low light tolerant strains|shade loving]]
4. [[cloning|great for cloning]]
5. [[reveging|good at re-veging]]
6. [[photoperiods]]
7. [[autoflowers]]
### strategies

#### disease resistance
polyhyrbid x polyhybrid = f1 -> f1 x f1 ...

#### terpenes and smell

## outdoor
1. [[triploid cannabis|Seedless]] *super fucking hard dude. or ghTb test lol*
2. [[poor soil]]
3. [[cannabis disease disease resistance]]
4. [[high thc strains|potency]]
5. [[outdoor strains with largest yeild|largest]]
6. patio (self topping)

### strategies

#### disease resistance
polyhyrbid x polyhybrid = f1 -> f1 x f1 ...
