- About us/our mission/ etc.
	- We want to improve cannabis
		- disease resistance
		- yield
		- product type
			- the best strain for hash isn't the best for butter
			- the best hash to smoke is terp heavy and probably wasted in products

## germination and propagation

Superthrive (one drop to a glass of water)  
Nitrozyme (10ml/L)  
Humic and fulvic acids (10ml/L)  
Rooting hormones  
peroxide  
if ever in peroxide floating doesn't point to dead seeds, as well floating vs sinking is not 100% accurate for finding seed viability.  
Liquid Seaweed Extract: Liquid seaweed extract contains various nutrients, trace elements, and growth-promoting compounds that can potentially enhance seed germination and seedling growth.

Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): Some growers add a small amount of vitamin B1 to the soaking water, as it's believed to promote root growth and overall plant health.
