### salt extending shelf life

## making cannabutter

### Equipment List:

1. **Commercial-Grade Double Boiler**: A large pot and a heat-resistant bowl that fits snugly on top.
2. **Stove or Induction Cooker**: For heating the water in the double boiler.
3. **Thermometer**: To monitor the temperature accurately.
4. **Cheesecloth and Strainer**: For straining the butter after infusion.
5. **Large Mason Jars**: For storing the infused butter.
6. **Decarboxylator**: To activate the THC in the cannabis before infusion (optional but recommended).
7. **Scale**: For precise measurement of cannabis and butter.
8. **Stirring Spoon**: To stir the mixture regularly.
9. **Timer**: To keep track of infusion time.

### Cannabutter Recipe:

#### Ingredients:

- **1 lb (450g) unsalted butter**
- **1 oz (28g) finely ground cannabis** (or more, depending on desired potency)
- **1 cup water**

#### Instructions:

1. **Decarboxylate the Cannabis**: If using a decarboxylator, follow the manufacturer's instructions to activate the THC. If not, preheat your oven to 240°F (115°C) and bake the ground cannabis on a baking sheet for 45-60 minutes3.
    
2. **Set Up the Double Boiler**: Fill the bottom pot with water and place it on the stove. Bring the water to a simmer1.
    
3. **Add Butter and Cannabis**: Place the butter in the heat-resistant bowl on top of the double boiler. Add the decarboxylated cannabis to the butter3.
    
4. **Infusion Process**: Stir the mixture well and let it simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Keep an eye on the water level in the bottom pot and add more water as needed to prevent it from boiling dry1.
    
5. **Strain the Mixture**: After the infusion time, place a cheesecloth over a strainer and set it over a large mason jar. Pour the butter mixture through the cheesecloth to strain out the plant material1.
    
6. **Cool and Store**: Allow the infused butter to cool at room temperature, then refrigerate it until it solidifies. The butter will separate from any remaining water, which can be poured off1.
    
7. **Use or Store**: Your cannabutter is now ready to use in recipes or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

# decrab
For optimal decarboxylation of THC, the recommended temperature range is between **220°F to 240°F (104°C to 115°C)**. Here are some guidelines:

- **220°F (104°C)** for **60 minutes**: This lower temperature helps preserve more terpenes, which contribute to the flavor and aroma of cannabis.
    
- **240°F (115°C)** for **30-40 minutes**: This is a common temperature and time combination that effectively decarboxylates THC without significant degradation2.
    #todo pressure canning rate
    

THC starts to degrade at temperatures around **315°F (157°C)**, but significant degradation occurs at higher temperatures, typically above **392°F (200°C)**4. At these elevated temperatures, THC can break down into other compounds, reducing its potency.

So, keeping the temperature within the recommended range ensures effective decarboxylation while preserving the potency of your cannabis. Happy decarbing!
