**Color**

Colored strains are very popular these days. Purple and pink buds are especially popular, but when it comes to color of buds, it’s difficult to stabilize a strain so that 100% of offspring are the same color as desired.

Cannabis is a ___ plant, meaning it has distinctly male and female plant.

A single male plant can pollinate tens of females. “It’s always a good idea to have only one male, genetically speaking, per pollination effort,” says Pennington. “A healthy male can pollinate up to 20 females, and by pollinate, I mean absolutely cover the plant with seeds.”

Put them on a flowering light cycle: 12 hours of light, 12 hours of dark.
