Choose a Mother Plant: Choose a healthy mother plant that has desirable traits. The mother plant should be at least two months into the vegetative cycle.

Cut a Clone: With a sterile razor, cut a branch from the mother plant at a 45-degree angle. This branch should be 8-10 inches long and have several nodes present.

Prepare the Clone: Remove the lower leaves and dip the cut end of the clone into a rooting gel or powder.

Plant the Clone: Place the clone into a growing medium such as rockwool cubes, peat moss, or directly into soil. Make sure the medium is moist.

Care for the Clone: Place the clone under a CFL light and keep the humidity high. Spray the clone with water a few times a day.

Wait for Root Development: After a week or two, roots should begin to develop. Once the roots are well established, the clone can be transplanted into a larger pot or garden.
