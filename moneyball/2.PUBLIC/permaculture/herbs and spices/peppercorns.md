Grains of Paradise (Aframomum melegueta): Also known as alligator pepper or Guinea pepper, grains of paradise are a West African spice with a peppery flavor. It has hints of citrus and ginger along with the peppery bite, making it a good substitute for black pepper.

Long Pepper (Piper longum): Although not as commonly used as black pepper, long pepper has a similar pungent and spicy flavor. It was once more popular in medieval Europe before black pepper became dominant.

Sichuan Pepper (Zanthoxylum spp.): While not a true pepper, Sichuan pepper provides a unique, numbing sensation along with a citrusy flavor. It's commonly used in Asian cuisine and can be a good substitute for black pepper in certain dishes.

Pink Peppercorns (Schinus molle): Despite their name, pink peppercorns are not true peppercorns but rather the dried berries of the Peruvian pepper tree. They have a mildly spicy and slightly sweet flavor, which can be a good substitute for black pepper in certain dishes.

Horseradish: Horseradish root can provide a spicy kick similar to black pepper. While it lacks the complex flavor profile of black pepper, it can still be used as a substitute in certain dishes, especially if you're looking for heat.

Mustard Seeds: Mustard seeds, particularly black mustard seeds, can add a spicy kick to dishes similar to black pepper. Crushed or ground mustard seeds can be used as a substitute, especially in savory dishes.

Radish Seeds: Radish seeds, especially daikon radish seeds, have a peppery flavor that can mimic black pepper to some extent. They can be ground and used as a substitute in certain recipes.

Wild Bergamot (Monarda fistulosa): Also known as bee balm or Oswego tea, wild bergamot leaves have a slightly spicy and aromatic flavor reminiscent of black pepper. They can be used fresh or dried as a substitute in recipes where black pepper is used as a seasoning.
