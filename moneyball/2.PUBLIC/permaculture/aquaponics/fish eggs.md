# non lethal
Yes, some types of fish roe can be harvested without killing the fish. There are several non-lethal methods now used, especially in aquaculture and for certain species:

- **Stripping and Milking:** For fish like salmon, trout, herring, and some sturgeon, eggs can be collected by gently massaging (stripping or milking) the abdomen to release the roe. This process does not harm the fish, allowing them to continue living and reproducing.
    
- **No-Kill Caviar Methods:** For sturgeon (the source of true caviar), newer methods include hormone-assisted "milking," where a protein is injected to loosen the eggs, or the Vivace method, which uses a calcium solution bath to stabilize the roe after extraction. Another technique is a minor surgical procedure (C-section) to remove the eggs, after which the fish is sewn up and allowed to recover. These methods are designed to keep the fish alive and productive for multiple harvests.
    
- **Sustainable Fish Farming:** Many farmed fish, especially salmon and trout, are routinely milked for their roe without being killed.
    

While these non-lethal methods are increasingly common, especially for farmed fish, traditional roe harvesting for many wild species still involves killing the fish. The adoption of humane, no-kill techniques is growing, particularly for sustainability and conservation reasons, but it is not yet universal for all types of edible fish eggs.
