Hypersaline lake  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bodies_of_water_by_salinity![link-external](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/external_link.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bodies_of_water_by_salinity)  
Lake Elton (20-50% why the fluctuation?)  
The search results indicate that while most fish species cannot survive the extreme salinities found in places like Lake Retba, a few specialized species like tilapia, atherinids, and some killifish have adapted physiological mechanisms to thrive in these hypersaline environments 12345. Their ability to reproduce successfully under such high salinity conditions is a key adaptation.

Fish that can reproduce at 10% of greater.  
Blackchin tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron) - This species has been found living in the highly saline Lake Retba (also known as Gaet'ale Pond), which has salinities up to 40% 124.  
Atherinid fish species (e.g. spotted hardyhead, common hardyhead) - These small fish have colonized and become abundant in the hypersaline Leschenault Estuary in Australia, where salinities can reach 54 3.  
California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis) - This species can tolerate salinities up to 128 ppt, with newly hatched larvae tolerating up to 70 ppt 4.  
Austrofundulus limnaeus - This killifish species inhabits ephemeral hypersaline lakes in Venezuela and has embryos that can defend internal osmolality up to 50 ppt salinity 4.
