The search results list several private aquaponics companies like Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems, Aquaponics USA, Aquaponics Source, Practical Aquaponics, Japan Aquaponics, Stuppy Inc., and Muddy River Farm Aquaponics.
These appear to be privately held businesses.
Ouroboros Farms is highlighted as one of the largest commercial aquaponic farms in the U.S., but no information is provided about it being a public company.
The Aquaponics Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting aquaponics, not a public company.
No publicly traded aquaponics companies or their stock tickers are explicitly mentioned in the search results.

# HOT WATER
What can survive high water temperatures?  
hot springs and desert pools

Rosy red minnows (Cyprinella lutrensis) and white cloud mountain minnows (Tanichthys albonubes), which can survive temperatures over 100째F (38째C)

  
What bodies of water get to the highest tempatures  
Any places where hot small pools dry up?  
Where water does get hot, how does what mineralize, or what is the mineral content?  
Discus (Symphysodon spp.) can thrive in temperatures around 84-86째F (29-30째C)

Design the chain link  
Thermodynamics for a system  
Solar oven, able to fan off heat  
Maybe rapid evaporation system
