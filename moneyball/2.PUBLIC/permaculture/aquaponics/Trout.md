!trout
    Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss):
        Rainbow trout are one of the most popular species for fish farming due to their fast growth rate, adaptability to various environments, and excellent taste.
        They can tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and are suitable for both coldwater and coolwater aquaculture systems.
        Rainbow trout have a distinctive pink flesh color and are highly sought after in the market.

    Brown Trout (Salmo trutta):
        Brown trout are native to Europe and have been introduced to many regions worldwide for aquaculture and recreational fishing.
        They prefer cooler water temperatures and are well-suited for coldwater streams and rivers.
        Brown trout have a delicate flavor and firm texture, making them prized by seafood enthusiasts.

    Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis):
        Brook trout are native to North America and are often found in cold, clear streams and lakes.
        They have a distinctive marbled appearance and are known for their delicate flavor and tender flesh.
        Brook trout can be challenging to farm due to their specific habitat requirements, but they can thrive in well-managed aquaculture systems.

    Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii):
        Cutthroat trout are native to North America and are valued for their flavorful flesh and attractive appearance.
        They inhabit cold, clean streams and rivers and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.
        Cutthroat trout are less commonly farmed than rainbow trout but may be suitable for aquaculture in certain regions.

    Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus):
        Arctic char are closely related to trout and are native to Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.
        They thrive in cold, well-oxygenated water and are known for their rich, buttery flavor.
        Arctic char can be challenging to farm due to their slow growth rate and specific environmental requirements, but they are prized by consumers for their high-quality flesh.

!salmon
    Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar):
        Atlantic salmon can adapt to both freshwater and saltwater environments throughout their life cycle.
        They are commonly farmed in net-pens in coastal marine waters, but they can also be raised in freshwater hatcheries for aquaponic systems.
        While Atlantic salmon are not as commonly used in aquaponics as other species, they can still be raised successfully in freshwater tanks with appropriate water quality management.

    Chinook Salmon (King Salmon) (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha):
        Chinook salmon are native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and are prized for their large size and rich flavor.
        They have a complex life cycle that includes spawning in freshwater rivers and streams.
        Chinook salmon can be raised in freshwater hatcheries for aquaponic systems, providing a sustainable source of protein and nutrients.

    Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch):
        Coho salmon are another Pacific salmon species commonly used in aquaculture and fisheries.
        They have a similar life cycle to Chinook salmon, spawning in freshwater streams before migrating to the ocean.
        Coho salmon can adapt well to freshwater environments and are suitable for aquaponic systems where water quality parameters are carefully monitored.

    Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha):
        Pink salmon are the smallest and most abundant of the Pacific salmon species.
        They have a relatively short life cycle and spend a minimal amount of time in freshwater before migrating to the ocean.
        While pink salmon are primarily associated with marine environments, they can also be raised in freshwater hatcheries for aquaponic use, particularly in regions where they are native.

    Chum Salmon (Oncorhynchus keta):
        Chum salmon are native to the Pacific Ocean and are known for their distinctive spawning behavior in freshwater rivers and streams.
        They are less commonly farmed than other Pacific salmon species but can still be raised in freshwater hatcheries for aquaponic systems.
        Chum salmon provide an alternative option for aquaponic growers looking to diversify their fish species.
