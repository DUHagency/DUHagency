# How to Qualify as a Wholesale Customer

At Johnny's, we define wholesalers as partners who purchase seeds to repackage and sell as seeds, not to grow and sell as starts or produce. We require purchases to be in bulk quantities per variety and an annual purchase threshold of at least $5000.

Please complete the form below to help us determine whether your operation qualifies for our wholesale program.
