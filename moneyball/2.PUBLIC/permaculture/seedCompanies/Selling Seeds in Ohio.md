Start by finding legit testers with decent followings on socials and get them to run your gear
You’re best bet imo is to try connecting with popular seed banks and get them to be your store fronts than doing direct sales

# Federal Regulation basics
- In 2022, [the DEA confirmed](https://www.omarfigueroa.com/dea-confirms-that-cannabis-seeds-tissue-culture-and-other-genetic-material-are-not-necessarily-controlled-under-the-csa/#:~:text=December%2021%2C%202022&text=The%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration%20) that purchasing cannabis seeds is legal in all States as they contain less than 0.3% THC, which means they are classed as hemp, and their sale is not restricted.
- Growing cannabis is legal in many US States, but you need to read your State laws and regulations before you start (see below)
- Although some local dispensaries and headshops sell seeds, ordering seeds online is cheaper, more convenient, and more discreet.
- When ordering seeds online, always buy from a seed bank that ships from **inside the USA**, as your seeds will arrive faster and won’t pass through customs.

Yes, you can legally sell seeds in Ohio, but there are specific regulations you need to follow. Here are the key requirements:

1. **Seed Labeler Permit**: You must obtain a Seed Labeler Permit from the Ohio Department of Agriculture. This permit is required if you label agricultural, vegetable, or flower seeds to be sold in Ohio2.
    
2. **Seed Testing**: The seeds must undergo a germination test within 12 months (for non-cool season grass seeds) or 15 months (for cool season grass seeds) prior to sale. If the seeds are in hermetically sealed containers, the test must be done within 36 months2.
    
3. **Labeling Requirements**: Seeds must be labeled according to sections 907.01 to 907.17 of the Ohio Revised Code. The label must include information such as the percentage of germination, the kind and variety of seeds, and the presence of any noxious-weed seeds2.
    
4. **Inspection and Fees**: Seeds sold in Ohio are subject to inspection and must meet certain standards. There are also inspection fees and tonnage report requirements2.
    
5. **Prohibited Seeds**: Ohio law prohibits the sale of seeds containing prohibited noxious-weed seeds or more than 0.25% by weight of restricted noxious-weed seeds.
    

It's important to ensure that you comply with all these regulations to legally sell seeds in Ohio. If you need more detailed information, you can visit the [Ohio Department of Agriculture's website](https://agri.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/oda/divisions/plant-health/laws-and-rules/?form=MG0AV3).

Yes, with the legalization of recreational marijuana in Ohio, you can sell cannabis seeds. However, there are specific regulations you need to follow:

1. **Licensing**: You must obtain the appropriate licenses from the Ohio Department of Commerce. This includes a cultivator license if you plan to grow and sell seeds.
    
2. **Compliance**: Ensure that your seeds meet the quality and safety standards set by the state. This includes proper labeling and testing.
    
3. **Age Restrictions**: You can only sell cannabis seeds to adults aged 21 and older.
    
4. **Advertising**: Follow the advertising guidelines set by the state to avoid promoting cannabis products to minors.
    

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Ohio Revised Code](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.29?form=MG0AV3) and the [Ohio Department of Commerce's Medical Marijuana Control Program](https://getseed.io/blog/ohio-retail-cannabis-laws?form=MG0AV3).
