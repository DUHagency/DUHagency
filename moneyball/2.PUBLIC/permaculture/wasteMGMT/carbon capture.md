Polymeric membranes have become a major focus for CO2 separation and capture research in recent years.  
Some of the key polymeric membrane materials investigated for CO2 separation include:

Ether oxygen-rich polymers  
Polymeric ionic liquids  
Shape-persisting glassy polymers (e.g. perfluoropolymers, thermally rearranged polymers, iptycene-containing polymers)  
Reactive polymers featuring facilitated transport mechanisms

These specialized polymeric membranes can achieve high CO2 permeability and selectivity, allowing for efficient separation of CO2 from gas mixtures like flue gas, natural gas, and biogas.  
One example is the "hybrid LDH-polymer membrane" described in the search result  
, which uses a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material combined with a facilitated transport agent to achieve exceptional CO2 selectivity.  
The search results indicate that membrane-based CO2 separation has advantages like high efficiency, simple process, and low energy consumption compared to other CO2 capture technologies.
