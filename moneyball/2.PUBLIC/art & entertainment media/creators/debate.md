get ad agencies to get ads from filmmakers


If everyone gets a piece people push harder and work harder.  If people believe they are expressions have vision in final products they tend to work even harder.

Debate one will lead to the first [[DUH bylaws]].  It will be simply, who gets the ad revenue and why?  Setting a standrad to brand.  Like I want fonts to be different and custom for the author of every blog post.  I want to sell the likes to the font.  I'd like to get a split between the calligraphist and writer, none for me the agent; why?; because assuming I can create the best network with the least means but the most amount of intelligence, well info is worth more than the longevity of profitability for the company.  We will starting a [[503.1c reg|non-profit]]. So these bylaws matter.  This will set the standard for [[muni level]], [[State level]], [[DUH chapter, regions, districts]], [[National Level]], and one day [[international level]].
