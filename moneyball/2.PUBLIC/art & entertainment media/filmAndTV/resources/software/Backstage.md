**Backstage** is a major American entertainment industry trade publication and digital platform focused on performers, casting, and job opportunities in the film, television, and theater industries. It was founded in 1960 in New York City by Allen Zwerdling and Ira Eaker as a weekly newspaper to serve actors and theater professionals[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstage_\(job_platform_and_publication\))[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstage.com)[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistro_Awards?oldformat=true)[7](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Backstage_\(magazine\))[8](https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/back-stage-2-37658/).
