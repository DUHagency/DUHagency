## FilmFreeway: What It Is

FilmFreeway is an online platform that allows filmmakers to submit their films to film festivals around the world for selection consideration. It serves as a central marketplace where filmmakers can discover, submit to, and manage entries for over 12,000 film festivals and contests, including many that are Academy Award and BAFTA accredited[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmFreeway)[2](https://filmfreeway.com/pages/how-it-works)[7](https://filmfreeway.com/). The platform is widely used in the independent film industry and has become the leading film festival submission service since the closure of Withoutabox in 2019[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmFreeway).
