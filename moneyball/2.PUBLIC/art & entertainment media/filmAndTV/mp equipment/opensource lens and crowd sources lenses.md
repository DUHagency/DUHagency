Sirui's Vision Prime 1 Series cine lenses are notable for their use of ED (extra-low dispersion) glass, HRI (high refractive index) glass, and aspherical elements. While Sirui does not sell optical glass sets directly, their published specifications can guide you in specifying the types of glass and coatings you'll want to order for your own cine lens build.
