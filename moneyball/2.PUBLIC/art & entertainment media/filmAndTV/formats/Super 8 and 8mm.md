# 720 p the max
The maximum resolution achievable for a Super 8mm film scan is debated, with some arguing for 2K or 4K. However, a more realistic estimate for the inherent resolution of Super 8 film is ==around 720p==, [according to Kinograph Forums](https://forums.kinograph.cc/t/8mm-super-8-16mm-scanning-resolution/2297/2). While 2K or 4K scans are possible, [according to Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/8mm/comments/1dj7xcp/is_scanning_in_4k_overkill/) they may not reveal significantly more detail than a 720p scan.

4,000 dpi
A 2K scan offers a good balance between resolution and file size, and it effectively captures the detail Super 8 film can hold
