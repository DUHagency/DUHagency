## Modern Motion Picture Film Still Developed (as of 2025)

Despite digital’s dominance, several motion picture film stocks remain in active production and are widely used by filmmakers today, especially for feature films, commercials, and high-end projects.

## **Kodak**

Kodak is the primary global manufacturer of motion picture film and continues to produce the following lines, all of which are available in 16mm and 35mm formats:

- **Kodak Vision3 Color Negative Film**
    
    - 50D 5203/7203 (Daylight)
        
    - 200T 5213/7213 (Tungsten)
        
    - 250D 5207/7207 (Daylight)
        
    - 500T 5219/7219 (Tungsten)  
        These are the industry standards for color negative capture and are used on major Hollywood, independent, and international productions[8](https://www.cined.com/film-vs-digital-in-2025-exploring-the-enduring-appeal-process-and-cost-of-shooting-on-kodak-vision-3/).
        
- **Kodak Tri-X Reversal Film**
    
    - Black-and-white reversal film, available in Super 8 and 16mm, popular for its classic grain and contrast.
        
- **Kodak Double-X 5222**
    
    - Black-and-white negative film, available in 35mm and 16mm, used for its traditional cinematic look.
        
- **Kodak Ektachrome 100D 7294**
    
    - Color reversal (slide) film, available in Super 8 and 16mm, revived due to demand from filmmakers and artists.
        

## **Other Manufacturers**

- **ORWO** (Germany)  
    ORWO produces black-and-white negative and intermediate films in 16mm and 35mm. Their UN54 and N75 stocks are used by experimental and independent filmmakers.
    
- **Film Ferrania** (Italy)  
    Ferrania has reintroduced limited runs of black-and-white and color reversal films for Super 8 and 16mm, with plans for further expansion.
    
- **Rumored and Boutique Stocks**  
    There are ongoing rumors and small-batch announcements from companies in Switzerland and China about new color film stocks, but as of mid-2025, Kodak remains the primary supplier for professional motion picture color negative film[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1hfoifc/what_film_stocks_will_be_released_new_or_brought/).
    

## **Discontinued or Rare**

- **Fujifilm** ceased production of motion picture film in 2013, though rumors persist about potential new manufacturing in China[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1hfoifc/what_film_stocks_will_be_released_new_or_brought/).
    

## **Summary Table**

| Manufacturer | Film Stock Type                      | Formats Available               | Notes                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [[Kodak]]    | Vision3 Color Negative               | [[16mm]], [[35mm]], [[65mm]]    | Industry standard, widely available |
| [[Kodak]]    | Tri-X, Double-X (B&W)                | [[16mm]], [[35mm]], [[Super 8 and 8mm]] | Classic B&W look                    |
| [[Kodak]]    | [[Ektachrome 100D]] (Color Reversal) | [[Super 8 and 8mm]], [[16mm]]           | For reversal/slide projection       |
| [[ORWO]]     | B&W Negative, Intermediate           | [[16mm]], [[35mm]]              | Niche/independent use               |
| [[Ferrania]] | B&W, Color Reversal (limited)        | [[Super 8 and 8mm]], [[16mm]]           | Boutique/experimental               |

**In summary:**  
Kodak Vision3 color negative film (in various speeds) is the main modern motion picture film stock still developed and used globally, with black-and-white and reversal options also available from Kodak, ORWO, and Ferrania[8](https://www.cined.com/film-vs-digital-in-2025-exploring-the-enduring-appeal-process-and-cost-of-shooting-on-kodak-vision-3/)[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1hfoifc/what_film_stocks_will_be_released_new_or_brought/).
## All Major Motion Picture Film Formats

Motion picture film formats refer to the physical characteristics of the film stock used for capturing and projecting movies. These formats are defined by film gauge (width), perforation type, aspect ratio, and sometimes unique frame arrangements or soundtracks. Below is a comprehensive overview of the most significant and widely used motion picture film formats throughout cinema history, from the earliest days to modern times.

## **Standard Film Gauges and Formats**

- **90mm Chronophotographe (1888)**  
    The first motion picture film format, developed by Étienne-Jules Marey in France[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/).
    
- **70mm / 65mm**  
    Used for high-resolution, large-format productions (e.g., IMAX, Todd-AO, Super Panavision 70). 65mm is used in cameras, 70mm for projection (the extra 5mm is for the magnetic soundtrack)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats)[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/).
    
- **35mm**  
    The industry standard since the 1890s, used for both shooting and projection. Variants include:
    
    - Standard 35mm (Academy ratio)
        
    - CinemaScope (anamorphic widescreen)
        
    - Super 35 (wider image area for cropping)
        
    - VistaVision (horizontal film transport for higher resolution)
        
    - Techniscope (2-perf, widescreen)
        
    - Panavision (modern anamorphic)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats)[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/).
        
- **28mm**  
    Used mainly for home movies and educational films in the early 20th century.
    
- **16mm**  
    Introduced by Kodak in 1923 for educational, documentary, and independent filmmaking. Variants include:
    
    - Standard 16mm
        
    - Super 16 (wider image area, single sprocket)[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/)[4](https://www.capture.com/blogs/film/the-evolution-of-film-formats).
        
- **9.5mm**  
    Popular in Europe for home movies, especially in the 1920s and 1930s.
    
- **8mm**  
    Introduced in 1932 by Kodak for home movies. Variants include:
    
    - Standard 8mm (Double 8)
        
    - Super 8 (introduced 1965, improved image area and sound capability)
        
    - Single 8 (Fuji’s alternative to Super 8)[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/)[4](https://www.capture.com/blogs/film/the-evolution-of-film-formats)[7](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/motion-picture-film-identify-formats.html).
        

## **Specialized and Notable Formats**

- **IMAX (15/70mm)**  
    Uses 70mm film with 15 perforations per frame, running horizontally for ultra-large images[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats).
    
- **Cinerama**  
    Three synchronized 35mm projectors for ultra-wide curved screens[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats).
    
- **Kinopanorama**  
    Soviet three-strip 35mm widescreen process[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats).
    
- **Ultra Panavision 70**  
    Anamorphic lenses on 65mm film for extremely wide aspect ratios[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats).
    
- **Technicolor**  
    Early color processes using multiple strips of 35mm film.
    

## **Summary Table of Key Film Formats**

|Film Gauge|Notable Formats & Variants|Era/Use|
|---|---|---|
|90mm|Chronophotographe|1888, earliest film|
|70/65mm|Todd-AO, IMAX, Super Panavision|Epic, high-res, IMAX|

## **Additional Notes**

- Many other experimental and regional formats have existed, but the above represent the most influential and widely adopted in the history of motion pictures[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_formats)[3](https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2023/10/for-your-consideration-all-about-film-formats/)[4](https://www.capture.com/blogs/film/the-evolution-of-film-formats)[7](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/motion-picture-film-identify-formats.html).
    
- Digital formats have now largely replaced film for both capture and projection, but these analog film formats remain central to the history and aesthetics of cinema.
