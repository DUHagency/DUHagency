Big named talent: Have you ever gone to see a movie just because an actor you like was in it? What about your favorite directors or producers? People are funny about entertainment. They want the guarantee that they'll enjoy themselves. We have all been conditioned to believe that certain actors and directors and producers will always put out exceptional content. We believe that, because this was produced by the Russo Brothers or because Chris Hemsworth is in it, it will be good. It's like each person who goes to see your film is a mini investor, "Is this film worth spending $15 and two hours of my time?" Big-name talent sells films because people trust them with their money.

Season: The time of year is a huge factor in whether or not your film will be distributed. Horror films generally do better in the autumn than they do in the spring. And Christmas movies do better in the winter than they do in the summer.

Bidding: Bidding is when the theater pays a fixed amount for the right to show the film. For example, the theater could bid $100,000 for a four-week long commitment to a film. If the film brings in more than that $100,000, the theater makes a profit. If they bring in less, the theater has a loss. Bidding isn't commonplace with most distribution companies anymore.

Percentage: With a percentage deal, the distributor and the movie theater negotiate several aspects.

The House Allowance - the weekly box office that theoretically allows a theatre to break-even.

The percentage split for the net box office. (What the box office is left with after the deduction of the house allowance).

The percentage for the gross box office is set.

The length of engagement (usually 4-6 weeks).

Marketing Materials – You will need to create your own trailer, posters, and still images for the cinema’s marketing. The poster print cost will depend on how many you get printed and how many theaters you screen within.
Publicist – Independent filmmakers could consider hiring a specialist PR company to get national press coverage for your film. Reviews from significant publications (both press and online) can vastly increase awareness of your film.
Advertising – This includes social media, TV promos, radio, and newspaper adverts. It’s likely as an independent filmmaker that this will be your highest expenditure.
DCP – A digital cinema package is your film’s hard drive. You will need to create a professional DCP for each cinema screening. Although you can create these yourself, it might be worth paying for a professional service such as Simple DCP.
