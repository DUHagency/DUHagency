## 
To start a film commission, ==you need government endorsement, define the services offered, ensure there's no conflict of interest, and have a clear understanding of funding sources==. A film commission typically provides location scouting, crew and service connections, government support, and production incentives. Additionally, it's crucial to have a robust digital location library and understand the local filming regulations and incentives. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Government Endorsement and Oversight:

- **Officially Recognized:**
    
    A film commission must be endorsed by the government of the region it serves. This endorsement grants the commission the authority to represent the region and promote it for film production.
    
- **Multiple Jurisdictions:**
    
    If the commission aims to cover multiple jurisdictions, it needs authorization from each governing body. 
    

2. Services Offered:

- **Comprehensive Support:**
    
    A film commission should provide a wide range of services to support film productions, including:
    
    - Location scouting and identification
    - Connections to local crew, facilities, and services
    - Access to government contacts and resources
    - Information on production incentives and tax credits
    - Permitting assistance
    
- **No Charge (Generally):**
    
    Services are typically provided at no charge, with the exception of permit fees. 
    

3. Conflict of Interest:

- **No Conflicts:** There must be no actual or apparent conflict of interest between the film commission and its commissioner. 

4. Funding and Operations:

- **Funding Sources:**
    
    Film commissions can be funded through:
    
    - Government agencies (e.g., governor's office, mayor's office, county board)
    - Chamber of Commerce
    - Convention and Visitors Bureaus
    - Corporate sponsorships
    - Private donations
    - Membership fees
    - Service fees
    - Permit fees
    
- **Non-Profit Status:**
    
    If the commission is a non-profit, it needs to establish a clear funding model. 
    

5. Digital Location Library:

- **Online Database:**
    
    A film commission needs a robust digital location library to showcase unique locations and landmarks within the region.
    
- **Accessibility:**
    
    The library should be easily accessible online for producers and production teams. 
    

6. Understanding Local Regulations:
