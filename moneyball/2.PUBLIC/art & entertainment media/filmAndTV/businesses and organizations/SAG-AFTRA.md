To get actors into the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is now SAG-AFTRA after merging with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, they must meet certain eligibility requirements123. Here are the steps:

Proof of Employment: A performer becomes eligible for SAG-AFTRA membership under one of the following conditions13:  
Proof of SAG-AFTRA, SAG or AFTRA employment as a principal performer or recording artist13.  
Proof of three days of SAG-AFTRA, SAG or AFTRA employment as a background actor13.  
Employment under an affiliated performers’ union13.

Submit Application & Proof of Eligibility: Submit your application along with proof of eligibility. The proof can be paycheck stubs or something printed out from the payroll company responsible for the projects you worked for4.

Pay Your Initiation Fee: This is where things get expensive. The national initiation fee rate is currently $3,000 (initiation fees may be lower in some areas). Annual base dues are $201.96. In addition, work dues are calculated at 1.575 percent of covered earnings up to $500,0002.

Attend An Orientation: After your application has been approved and you’ve paid your initiation fee, you’ll need to attend an orientation4.

Please note that each application is vetted for legitimacy. That means your proof of employment will be fully investigated by SAG-AFTRA for validity1. False representation or deception on your part will jeopardize your chances to join SAG-AFTRA2. If you are eligible under the conditions stated above, please contact your nearest SAG-AFTRA local so that they can advise you of the amount of your joining fees1.
