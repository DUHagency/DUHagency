# The catch 22
- **Be hired to write by a company that is a WGA signatory** (a company that has signed a Guild contract)[](https://www.wgaeast.org/eligibility/).
    
- **Earn enough "units"** through writing employment or sales within the Guild’s jurisdiction. You need at least 24 units within three years to qualify for Current (full) membership[](https://www.wga.org/the-guild/going-guild/join-the-guild)[](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-do-you-join-the-wga/)[](https://www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/other-contracts/how-to-join-wgaw-through-lba). Units are earned by selling scripts, being hired for writing assignments, or similar work with signatory companies.
    
- **Pay the initiation fee**: $2,500 for Current membership. Dues are 1.5% of gross writing income plus $25 per quarter[](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-do-you-join-the-wga/)[](https://www.carolekirschner.com/blog/joinwga).
    
- If you have fewer than 24 units, you may be eligible for Associate membership, which has fewer benefits and costs $100 per year[](https://www.wga.org/the-guild/going-guild/join-the-guild)[](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-do-you-join-the-wga/)[](https://www.carolekirschner.com/blog/joinwga).

## Other pathways to membership: Caucuses and Organizing

**If you are ineligible to join the Writers Guild because you are not employed by a signatory company**, but your field of work falls within one of the Guild’s jurisdictional areas, there are still ways in which the Guild may be able to support you and your work through the Guild’s [Caucuses](https://www.wgaeast.org/caucuses/) and [Organizing](https://www.wgaeast.org/organize/) work.

As is the case with the two types of Guild Contracts, whether Caucuses or Organizing is the most appropriate avenue for a given writer depends on their field of work:

As a general rule, those who work in fields that fall under the jurisdiction of a Film/TV/Streaming contract or the Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA) should pursue engagement with the relevant Guild Caucus, whereas those whose work would fall under the jurisdiction of a Broadcast/Cable/Streaming News or Online Media contract or collective bargaining agreement should contact the Organizing department. 

Joining a Guild Caucus and Organizing your workplace are both excellent ways for prospective members to engage with their member and non-member peers, learn more about the protections and services provided by the Guild, and forge a pathway toward Writers Guild membership. We encourage you to explore involvement through these routes.
