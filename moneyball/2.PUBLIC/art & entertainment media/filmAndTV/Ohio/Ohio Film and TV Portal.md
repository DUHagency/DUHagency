# Communities to Join

## Facebook groups

### MOFA
1. **Mission & Structure**:  
    MOFA was founded in **October 2008** to support indie filmmakers in central Ohio through networking, resource-sharing, and professional development. It operates as a grassroots collective but does not state nonprofit status on its website 15.
2. **Financial/Legal Status**:
    - No EIN or IRS tax-exempt records appear in the search results.
    - Unlike groups like _Gateway Film Foundation_ or _Fevered Dreams Productions_ (which are confirmed nonprofits with revenue data), MOFAâ€™s financial structure isnâ€™t documented 28.
3. **Activities**:  
    Hosts monthly meetings at **Studio 35** in Columbus and lists a P.O. Box address, typical of small volunteer-run orgs. One board member (Lewis Gordon) is affiliated with MOFA and also works with _PRAUSmedia_, a nonprofitâ€”but this doesnâ€™t confirm MOFAâ€™s status 9.
4. **Comparison**:  
    Similar groups like _Hispanic Filmmakers of Cleveland_ (EIN: 84-3321276) are registered nonprofits, while MOFA lacks such transparency 6.
- MOFA functions as a **community collective** but may not be a formal 501(c)(3).
- For verification, you could:
    - Request MOFAâ€™s EIN or determination letter directly.
    - Search the IRS Tax Exempt Organization Database using its name/P.O. Box 2.
