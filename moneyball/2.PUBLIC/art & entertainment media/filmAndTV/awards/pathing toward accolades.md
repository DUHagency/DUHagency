The seven consecutive days of the theatrical release are required to occur in one venue.

*"Members may be invited to attend in-person “For Your Consideration” (FYC)
screenings held by motion picture companies that may include an in-person Q&A
session (Q&A) or panel discussion. FYC screenings are defined as screenings of
Oscar-eligible motion pictures for Academy members in a theater or screening
room in a non-residential place of business. Invitations to such screenings must be
sent through an Academy-approved mailing house. Non- Academy members may
be invited to FYC screenings. Film Festival screenings, premieres, guild
screenings, screening series, and other similar events that comply with these
regulations may also be used as an FYC screening. The Academy cannot regulate
non-FYC events as they are not organized for Academy members to view a motion
picture"*;  [[https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/2024-04/97th_oscars_complete_regulations.pdf|part 2 general]]
