# Reality of Becoming a writer
If you want to be employeed by one of the [[2.PUBLIC/art & entertainment media/filmAndTV/businesses and organizations/seven Major Studios]], you need to be in the [[2.PUBLIC/art & entertainment media/filmAndTV/businesses and organizations/organizations 1/WGA]]
It would increase your odds of success to move to filmmaking and television meccas like Los Angeles, Toronto, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and other centers where studios and production companies are based. You can look for entry-level jobs that can implant you within the industry. And while you do that, you can be making invaluable connections to help get you the proper opportunities you need to get your stories into the hands of those that can buy and produce them.   
  
It’s not essential, mind you. But it will increase your odds of success selling your screenplay tenfold.
