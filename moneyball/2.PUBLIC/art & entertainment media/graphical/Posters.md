## market focus on subject
- gardening
Local man lol relatively speaking.  Cold is the market.  Focusing on the limitation of gardening in cold climates. Canada, and Northern US.  Local content, needs generalization, like a city or state. So if majority of a state is warm, then state falls out, right.  Like California, would want tropical fruits, not like in the mountains where it gets p cold.  
- cannabis
Disease resistance!  Allow promicious pollination.  Then f1 from all that lol (not anything gentically similar), grow insane amount in smallest space possible, but thin to moderate it lol.
