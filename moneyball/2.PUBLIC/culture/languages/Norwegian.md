# Outside Norway

- **[[Swedish Americans|Sweden]] and [[Danish Americans|Denmark]]:** Norwegian is not an official language, but due to the close linguistic relationship between Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish, many people in Sweden and Denmark can understand and sometimes speak Norwegian. There are also Norwegian-speaking communities in these countries, and mutual intelligibility allows for significant cultural and linguistic exchange[](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-norwegian)

- **[[2.PUBLIC/1.location/national/USA]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]]:** There are Norwegian-speaking communities, particularly among descendants of Norwegian immigrants. These communities number in the tens of thousands in the US and UK, and smaller numbers in Canada[](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-norwegian)

- **Other Scandinavian countries:** In Iceland and Finland, especially in Swedish-speaking regions, some people may understand Norwegian due to cultural and linguistic ties, though Norwegian is not widely spoken there[](https://talkpal.ai/which-countries-speak-the-norwegian-language-best/)
