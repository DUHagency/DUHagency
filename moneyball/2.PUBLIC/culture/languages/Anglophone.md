*Johannesburg's metro population is often cited just under 10 million, but some broader definitions push it over this threshold.

## Notes:

- **Toronto**, **Houston**, and **Sydney** are large English-speaking metros but are generally below 10 million as of 2025.
    
- **Delhi**, **Mumbai**, **Manila**, and other very large cities have widespread English ability, but less than 50% of the population uses English as a primary or proficient second language.
    
- **Other African metros** (e.g., Nairobi, Kenya) are large and English is official, but most are below 10 million.
    
- **No major city in Canada, Australia, or New Zealand** exceeds 10 million in metro population.
