The largest Uyghur population in the United States is found in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, particularly in Fairfax County, Virginia. Several thousand Uyghurs are estimated to live in this region, making it the most significant Uyghur community in the country[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Americans)[](https://www.uyghuraa.org/who-are-the-uyghurs)[](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=younghistorians). Other cities with notable Uyghur populations include Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Houston, Boston, Austin, and Virginia Beach, but none are as large as the D.C./Northern Virginia area[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Americans)[](https://www.uyghuraa.org/who-are-the-uyghurs)

.

Estimates for the total Uyghur population in the U.S. range from 8,000 to 15,000, with the majority concentrated in the greater Washington, D.C. area
