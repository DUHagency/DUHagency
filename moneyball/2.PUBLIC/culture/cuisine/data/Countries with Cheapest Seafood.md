# **2. Budget-Friendly Fish Varieties**

Avoid overpriced or low-quality options by prioritizing these affordable and nutritious picks:

- **Basa/Tilapia**: Often cheaper than salmon but versatile for tacos, curries, or baking 9. Note: Opt for tilapia farmed in Colombia/Indonesia (not China) to avoid poor farming practices 2.
    
- **Sardines/Mackerel**: Inexpensive, high in omega-3s, and great for salads or pasta 9.
    
- **Canned Tuna**: A pantry staple for sandwiches, salads, or casseroles. Light meat in water is typically the cheapest 49.
    
- **Whole Fish**: Buying whole (e.g., carp, catfish) is cheaper than fillets. Use bones for stock to minimize waste 9.
    

_Avoid_: Monkfish (weird texture), orange roughy (high mercury), and non-sushi-grade raw fish (safety risk) 29.

- **Offcuts/Irregular Pieces**: Ask fishmongers for cheaper "ugly" cuts perfect for pies or soups 9.
