## types of flour for bread
### Wheat-Based Flours (Most Common for Bread)

- **All-Purpose Flour** – A blend of hard and soft wheat; moderate protein (10-12%). Works for basic bread but may lack strength for artisanal loaves.
    
- **Bread Flour** – Higher protein (12-14%) from hard wheat; more gluten for chewy, structured bread (e.g., baguettes, sourdough).
    
- **Whole Wheat Flour** – Contains the entire wheat kernel (bran, germ, endosperm). Nutritious but dense; often mixed with white flour for better rise.
    
- **White Whole Wheat Flour** – Milder than traditional whole wheat, made from hard white wheat.
    
- **High-Gluten Flour** (14-15% protein) – Used for chewy bread like bagels or pizza dough.
    
- **Durum Wheat Flour (Semolina)** – Coarse, high-protein flour used in Italian bread (e.g., semolina bread) and pasta.
    

### Ancient & Alternative Wheat Flours

- **Spelt Flour** – Nutty flavor, moderate gluten (weaker than wheat), works in rustic breads.
    
- **Einkorn Flour** – One of the oldest wheat varieties; mild flavor, lower gluten (requires careful handling).
    
- **Emmer (Farro) Flour** – Earthy taste, used in traditional Italian and Middle Eastern breads.
    
- **Kamut® (Khorasan Wheat)** – Rich, buttery flavor; higher protein but less elastic gluten.
    

### Gluten-Free Flours (Often Blended for Bread)

- **Rye Flour** (Low-gluten) – Used in sourdough rye or pumpernickel (dense, tangy). Pure rye bread relies on sourdough fermentation.
    
- **Buckwheat Flour** – Gluten-free, earthy flavor; used in flatbreads or mixed with wheat.
    
- **Oat Flour** – Adds moisture and sweetness; usually combined with other flours.
    
- **Almond Flour** – Low-carb, gluten-free; requires eggs/binders for structure.
    
- **Rice Flour** (White/Brown) – Light texture; common in gluten-free blends.
    
- **Sorghum Flour** – Mild, nutritious; used in gluten-free bread mixes.
    
- **Tapioca/Cassava Flour** – Chewy texture; helps bind gluten-free doughs.
    

### Specialty Flours

- **Rye Flour** (Light/Dark/Pumpernickel) – Varies by milling; dark rye has more bran for intense flavor.
    
- **Malt Flour/Diastatic Malt** – Enhances yeast activity and browning (common in bagels).
    
- **Sprouted Grain Flour** – Made from sprouted wheat or other grains; sweeter, easier to digest.

# Gluten Free
[Gluten-free breads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet#Gluten-free_bread "Gluten-free diet") are made using flours from a variety of ingredients such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, legumes such as beans, and tubers such as cassava. Since these foods lack gluten, dough made from them may not hold its shape as the loaves rise, and their crumb may be dense with little aeration. Additives such as [xanthan gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum "Xanthan gum"), [guar gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guar_gum "Guar gum"), [hydroxypropyl methylcellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxypropyl_methylcellulose "Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose") (HPMC), [corn starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_starch "Corn starch"), or [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food "Egg as food") are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.[[5.MEMOS/2025-09-18|2025-09-]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread#cite_note-LamacchiaCamarca2014-18)[[1.assets/Pasted image 20250710194337.png|Pasted image 202507104337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread#cite_note-VoltaCaio2015Quotation-19)[[1.assets/CountyEconomicStatusandDistressAreasFY2023DataTables.xls|CountyEconomicStatusandDistressAreasFY23DataTables]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread#cite_note-MulderWanrooijQuotation-20)[[1.assets/Excalidraw/Drawing 2025-05-23 01.21.02.excalidraw|Drawing 2025-05-23 01..02.excalidraw]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread#cite_note-HischenhuberCrevelQuotation-21)
