# Baking & Cooking Substitutes

- **Baking**:
    
    - Replace butter/oil with Greek yogurt in muffins, cakes, or banana bread (1:1 substitution for oil; for butter, use half the amount).
        
    - Use in place of mayo in cornbread or biscuits.
        
- **Mashed Potatoes**:
    
    - Swap butter or cream for yogurt for creamier, protein-packed potatoes.
        
- **Egg Substitute**:
    
    - For baking, use ¼ cup yogurt per egg in recipes like pancakes or muffins.

## **4. Miscellaneous Uses**

- **Homemade Cheese (Labneh)**:
    
    - Strain Greek yogurt through cheesecloth for 12–24 hours to make a spreadable cheese. Season with za’atar and olive oil.
        
- **Flatbreads/Naan**:
    
    - Add yogurt to dough for soft, fluffy flatbreads.
        
- **Emergency Substitute**:
    
    - Use in place of buttermilk, sour cream, or crème fraîche in recipes.

## **Tips for Success**

- **Texture**: Full-fat Greek yogurt is creamier and less tangy than low-fat.
    
- **Heat Sensitivity**: Avoid boiling yogurt-based sauces to prevent separation; warm gently.
    
- **Flavor Balance**: Balance tanginess with sweeteners (honey) or acidity (lemon juice).
