# [saucy harvest beets](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=saucy+harvest+beets)[![link](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/img/icons/link.png)](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-index.php?page=beet-recipes#saucy_harvest_beets)

I don't like raw beets, and yet to have pickled beet I like.

Beets are slept on veggie big time. Big time for salads. A fresh tasting acid like lemon juice, overtop of roast beets, is thee best salad. The texture superb.

Best soups to make beets.
