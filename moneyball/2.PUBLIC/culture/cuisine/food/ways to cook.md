# Dry Heat Cooking (No Liquid, High Heat)

- **Grilling** – Cooking over direct flame/charcoal (e.g., burgers, kebabs).
    
- **Broiling** – High heat from above (like an upside-down grill).
    
- **Roasting** – Slow-cooking in an oven (e.g., whole chicken, vegetables).
    
- **Baking** – Similar to roasting but often for bread, cakes, and pastries.
    
- **Searing** – Browning meat at high heat before finishing (e.g., steaks).
    
- **Toasting** – Dry heat for bread, nuts, or spices.
    
- **Smoking** – Slow-cooking with wood smoke (e.g., brisket, salmon).
    
- **Griddling** – Cooking on a flat surface (e.g., pancakes, burgers).
    
- **Pan-Frying** – Shallow oil in a skillet (e.g., fried chicken, eggs).
    
- **Deep-Frying** – Submerging in hot oil (e.g., French fries, tempura).
    
- **Sautéing** – Quick-frying in a small amount of oil (e.g., stir-fries).
    
- **Stir-Frying** – High-heat, fast cooking with constant stirring.

# Moist Heat Cooking (Using Water/Liquid)
- **Boiling** – Cooking in bubbling water (e.g., pasta, potatoes).
- **Simmering** – Gentle boiling (e.g., soups, stews).
- **Poaching** – Cooking in barely simmering liquid (e.g., eggs, fish).
- **Steaming** – Using vapor from boiling water (e.g., dumplings, veggies)    
- **Blanching** – Briefly boiling then shocking in ice water (e.g., veggies).
- **Sous Vide** – Vacuum-sealed food cooked in precise water baths.

# Combination Cooking (Dry + Moist Heat)
- **Braising** – Slow-cooking in liquid after searing (e.g., pot roast).
- **Stewing** – Similar to braising but with smaller food pieces.

# Other Unique Methods
- **Microwaving** – Quick heating using radiation.
- **Air-Frying** – Circulating hot air for crispy results.
- **Curing** – Preserving with salt/sugar (e.g., bacon, gravlax).
- **Fermenting** – Using microbes (e.g., kimchi, yogurt).
    
- **Raw/Cold Prep** – No heat (e.g., sushi, ceviche, salads).
    
- **Infusing** – Extracting flavors (e.g., oils, teas).
    
- **Rotisserie** – Slow-roasting on a rotating spit.
    
- **Solar Cooking** – Using sunlight in specialized ovens.
    
- **Pit Cooking** – Burying food with hot coals (e.g., Hawaiian luau pig).
