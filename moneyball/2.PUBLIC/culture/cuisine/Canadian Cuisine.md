All-dressed (Montreal Style): This hot dog, usually a 'steamie', is topped with mustard, chopped onion, relish and fresh coleslaw or plain chopped cabbage ("choux" in French); however, sauerkraut, or coleslaw of the creamy variety, is rarely used. An all-dressed hot dog typically does not include ketchup, which must be requested specifically.  
Michigan hot dog: This hot dog is topped with meat chili sauce or spaghetti sauce. It can be served with or without diced onions and mustard.  
Supreme: The hot dog is topped with cheese and bacon. This variation comes from Lafleur Restaurants.

Jiggs dinner  
Cretons Quebec pate  
The meal most typically consists of salt beef (or salt riblets), boiled together with potatoes, carrot, cabbage, turnip, and greens. Pease pudding and figgy duff are cooked in pudding bags immersed in the rich broth that the meat and vegetables create.[2](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/2) Condiments are likely to include mustard pickles, pickled beets, cranberry sauce, butter, and a thin gravy made from the cooking broth.
