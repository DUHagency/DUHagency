Many ancient religions faded due to the spread of monotheistic faiths (Christianity, Islam) or syncretism (absorption into new belief systems). However, some, like Hinduism and Zoroastrianism, survive today, while others (Norse, Egyptian) have seen modern revivals.

The **Celtic religion** was practiced by the Celtic peoples of Europe, including the Gauls (France), Britons (Britain), Gaels (Ireland, Scotland), and other tribes across Central and Western Europe before the spread of Christianity. The Celts left no written religious texts, so much of what we know comes from archaeology, Roman accounts, and later Irish and Welsh medieval manuscripts.

# **Key Features of Celtic Religion**

## **1. **Polytheism & Deities**

The Celts worshipped a wide array of gods and goddesses, often associated with nature, war, fertility, and craftsmanship. Some key deities include:

- **Lugh** (Irish: _Lú_) – God of skill, kingship, and the sun; namesake of _Lughnasadh_ festival.
    
- **Brigid** (Irish: _Brigit_) – Goddess of healing, poetry, and smithcraft; later Christianized as St. Brigid.
    
- **Dagda** – The "Good God," a father-figure associated with fertility, magic, and the cauldron of plenty.
    
- **Morrigan** – A shapeshifting goddess of war, fate, and sovereignty, often appearing as a crow.
    
- **Cernunnos** – The "Horned God," associated with animals, forests, and fertility (depicted with antlers).
    
- **Taranis** – Thunder god, similar to Thor or Jupiter.
    

🔹 **Regional Variations:**

- **Gaulish Celts** worshipped gods like **Esus, Teutates, and Belenus**.
    
- **Britons** had deities like **Nodens** (linked to healing).
    
- **Irish & Welsh mythology** (written down later) includes figures like **Manannán mac Lir** (sea god) and **Arawn** (Welsh underworld ruler).

## **2. **Druids: The Celtic Priesthood**

The **Druids** were the religious leaders, judges, and scholars of Celtic society.

- **Roles:**
    
    - Conducted rituals, sacrifices, and divination.
        
    - Memorized vast oral traditions (Celts discouraged writing religious knowledge).
        
    - Acted as advisors to kings.
        
- **Practices:**
    
    - **Oak & Mistletoe:** Pliny the Elder described a ritual where Druids cut mistletoe from oak trees (seen as sacred).
        
    - **Human Sacrifice?** Roman sources claim Druids performed human sacrifices (e.g., wicker man), but evidence is debated.
        

---

## **3. **Sacred Sites & Nature Worship**

- **Groves & Forests:** The Celts held rituals in natural spaces, especially oak groves (_nemeton_).
    
- **Water Cults:** Rivers, lakes, and springs were sacred (e.g., **Sulis** at Bath, England).
    
- **Stone Circles & Burial Mounds:**
    
    - **Newgrange (Ireland)** – A Neolithic tomb linked to Celtic myth.
        
    - **Stonehenge (Britain)** – Though pre-Celtic, later associated with Druids.
        

---

## **4. **Festivals & the Celtic Calendar**

The Celtic year was divided by four major festivals (still observed in modern Paganism):

1. **Samhain** (Oct 31 – Nov 1) – New Year, when spirits crossed over; origin of Halloween.
    
2. **Imbolc** (Feb 1) – Festival of Brigid, marking the start of spring.
    
3. **Beltane** (May 1) – Fertility festival with bonfires (maypoles later derived from this).
    
4. **Lughnasadh** (Aug 1) – Harvest festival honoring Lugh.
    

---

## **5. **Afterlife & Otherworld Beliefs**

- **The Otherworld (_Tír na nÓg_ in Irish myth):** A paradise-like realm of eternal youth.
    
- **Reincarnation:** Some texts suggest belief in rebirth (e.g., Welsh _Mabinogion_).
    
- **Burial Practices:**
    
    - Some graves included goods for the afterlife.
        
    - Heroes were sometimes buried in mounds (_sídhe_), believed to be entrances to the Otherworld.
        

---

# **Decline & Legacy**

- **Roman Conquest:** Many Celtic gods were merged with Roman deities (e.g., **Sulis-Minerva**).
    
- **Christianization:** By the 5th–6th centuries CE, most Celtic regions converted, but folklore survived (e.g., fairies = _Tuatha Dé Danann_).
    
- **Modern Revival:**
    
    - **Neo-Druidism** (18th–19th century revival).
        
    - **Celtic Paganism (CRs)** – Reconstructionist movements today.
