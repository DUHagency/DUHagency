# Agriculture
- [ ] what type of sheep
Greenland does have **agriculture**, though it is limited by the harsh Arctic climate and short growing season. The main form of agriculture is **sheep farming**, which dominates the sector, especially in **South Greenland**. Most of the cultivated land is used for growing grass as winter fodder for livestock, with a small portion used for crops like **potatoes** and **turnips**[1](https://natur.gl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENG-Synthesis-Report-on-Agriculture-in-GL.pdf)[2](https://trap.gl/en/natur-og-landskab/kulturlandskaber/)[6](https://www.rml.is/static/files/RML_LOGN/2024/landbrugssamarbedje_-greenland_country_notes.pdf)[7](https://climatechange.umaine.edu/2024/08/29/impacts-of-changing-arctic-freshwater-resources-on-south-greenland-farm-water-use-and-irrigation-systems/). There are also some cattle and caribou farming operations, and historically, Vikings grew hardy grains such as **barley** and **rye**[5](https://app.studyraid.com/en/read/9120/260709/agricultural-practices-in-greenland).

- The total cultivated area is small (about 1,100 hectares in 2014), with an additional large area used for summer grazing[1](https://natur.gl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENG-Synthesis-Report-on-Agriculture-in-GL.pdf).
    
- The agricultural landscape in South Greenland, known as **Kujataa**, is recognized for its blend of Norse and Inuit farming traditions, including grazing and small-scale crop cultivation[3](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1536/)[7](https://climatechange.umaine.edu/2024/08/29/impacts-of-changing-arctic-freshwater-resources-on-south-greenland-farm-water-use-and-irrigation-systems/).
    
- Modern Greenlandic farms often combine agriculture with other livelihoods such as fishing, hunting, and tourism[2](https://trap.gl/en/natur-og-landskab/kulturlandskaber/).
    
- Climate change is gradually expanding the potential for agriculture, but challenges remain, including poor soil quality, unpredictable precipitation, and the need for irrigation and fertilization[2](https://trap.gl/en/natur-og-landskab/kulturlandskaber/)[8](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-glacial-flour-opportunities-greenlandic-agriculture.html).
    

In summary, while **agriculture exists in Greenland**, it is primarily focused on sheep farming and limited crop production in the milder southern regions, with ongoing adaptation to environmental and economic challenges[1](https://natur.gl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENG-Synthesis-Report-on-Agriculture-in-GL.pdf)[2](https://trap.gl/en/natur-og-landskab/kulturlandskaber/)[6](https://www.rml.is/static/files/RML_LOGN/2024/landbrugssamarbedje_-greenland_country_notes.pdf)[7](https://climatechange.umaine.edu/2024/08/29/impacts-of-changing-arctic-freshwater-resources-on-south-greenland-farm-water-use-and-irrigation-systems/).
