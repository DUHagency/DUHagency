Congolese authors use literature as a way to develop a sense of national consciousness amongst the people of the DRC. Frederick Kambemba Yamusangie writes literature for the between generations of those who grew up in the Congo, during the time when they were colonised, fighting for independence and after. Yamusangie in an interview[269](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/269) said he felt the distance in literature and wanted to remedy that he wrote the novel, Full Circle, which is a story of a boy named Emanuel who in the beginning of the book feels a difference in culture among the different groups in the Congo and elsewhere.[270](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/270) Rais Neza Boneza, an author from the Katanga province, wrote novels and poems to promote artistic expressions as a way to address and deal with conflicts.[271](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/271)

About 30% of the Congolese population can fluently speak French.  
The majority of the French speakers in Congo (88%) live in the urban area of Brazzaville.

Almost every ethnic and sub-ethnic group in Congo has retained their traditional languages. The largest ethnic language in the Republic of the Congo is Kituba. Kituba is mainly spoken as a primary language in the southern half of the country, in regions such as Kouilou, Niari, Pool, and Brazzaville. It is also a national language and is spoken by over 50.35%

Two companies run by Catholic priests also employed Africans in making films about religious values. These were:

The Congolese Center for Catholic Action Cinema (CCCAC, French: Le Centre Congolais d'Action Catholique Cinéma) in Léopoldville  
Africa Films in Kivu.
