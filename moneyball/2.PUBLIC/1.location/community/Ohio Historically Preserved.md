Ohio has a robust system for preserving its historical heritage, supported by a wide array of organizations at the state, regional, and local levels.

# Statewide Leadership

- **State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO):** As the official historic preservation agency, SHPO oversees the identification, nomination, and protection of historic sites across Ohio. It manages the National Register of Historic Places nominations, reviews rehabilitation projects for tax credits, and offers grants, technical assistance, and educational programming. SHPO is part of the Ohio History Connection and has operated since 1967, following the National Historic Preservation Act[](https://www.ohiohistory.org/preserving-ohio/state-historic-preservation-office/)

- **Preservation Ohio:** This is the state’s oldest nonprofit dedicated to advocacy, education, and highlighting endangered historic sites. Since 1993, it has published the annual "Ohio’s Most Endangered Historic Sites" list, which has helped save and repurpose numerous landmarks[](https://preserveohio.com/about-preservation-ohio/)
