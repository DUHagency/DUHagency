Tax credits are designed to replace tax liability. Therefore, to receive a tax credit, the production company must file an Ohio tax return when the production is completed. The allowable credit can be taken against the financial institutions tax, the personal income tax or the commercial activities tax.

# Who qualifies for the Ohio Motion Picture tax credit?

The tax credit is available to eligible production companies or entities that are registered to do business in Ohio, producing a tax credit eligible production, with a minimum $300,000 per project spend in Ohio. A tax credit eligible production may be produced by an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other form of business association producing an eligible production as defined in ORC 122.85(A)(5)-(9).

An eligible production company must meet all requirements provided in the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio Administrative Code as applicable.

How much money is available through the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit?

$40 million in Motion Picture Tax Credits is available beginning July first each year. Applications may be submitted at any time. Applications are reviewed and approved in two rounds each fiscal year. . The first round of credits shall be awarded not later than the last day of July of the fiscal year, and the second round of credits shall be awarded not later than the last day of the ensuing January. The amount of credits awarded in the first round of applications each fiscal year shall not exceed twenty million dollars plus any credit allotment that was not awarded in the preceding fiscal year and carried over.

# How big does my production have to be to be eligible for the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit?

The entire amount of your spending in Ohio must be at least $300,000 to be eligible for tax credits.

# How does the tax credit work?

The program provides a refundable tax credit certificate to be taken against the financial institutions tax, the personal income tax or the commercial activities tax. The credit is based on eligible production expenditures (EPEs) in Ohio (see below).

# What's an Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit Certificate?

Upon completion of filming, the production entity must submit documentation of qualifying expenditures and any other documentation required by the Ohio Film Office. Once this process has been completed, the Ohio Film Office will issue an Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit Certificate stating the final amount of tax credit the production is eligible to receive.

# When can an applicant receive the Tax Credit Certificate?

The entire project must be completed and ready for distribution. Once the project is completed, the applicant may apply to the director of development services for a refundable credit. The applicant must submit an audit report prepared by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) along with the name and address of each production contractor with which the production company contracted for services and the amount of eligible expenditures paid or incurred under the contract with respect to the production. The CPA must certify that the requirements of the program are met. A form for use by the CPA is provided at the time the project is certified as a tax credit eligible production. The Ohio Film Office will review the reports and issue a Tax Credit Certificate if funds are available.

# I just found out about the incentive program and I've nearly completed filming. Can I still apply?

Yes, however, expenditures made prior to the project receiving certification as a tax credit eligible production (an award letter) will not qualify as eligible expenditures.
