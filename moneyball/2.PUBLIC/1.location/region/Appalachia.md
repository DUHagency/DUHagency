!Commission
The Appalachian Regional Commission was established in 1965 to address economic distress in
the Appalachian region.3 The ARCâ€™s jurisdiction spans 423 counties in Alabama, Georgia,
Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia (Figure 1). The ARC was originally created to
address severe economic disparities between Appalachia and that of the broader United States;
recently, its mission has grown to include regional competitiveness in a global economic
environment
