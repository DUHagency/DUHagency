crazy goal. Arc small plot development program.  
smaller goal: seed library.

seed library  
but perferrabley a seed exchange. What you got, and how accurate is it. Can we have some to hold reputation of the program to increase the vaibility of the program to benefit the greater community?  
seed library dont work because you can't foi

we want outlets to cover us (local news-> nation magazines, make mag... southern living (just kidding but make magazine is a possibility)
