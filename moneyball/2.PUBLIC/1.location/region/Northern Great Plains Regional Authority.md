The Northern Great Plains Regional Authority (NGPRA)  
was created in 2002 (P.L. 107-171) to address economic  
distress in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and  
South Dakota. While the NGPRA was authorized $30  
million from FY2002 to FY2018, it appears to have  
received appropriations onceâ€”for $1.5 million in FY2004  
(P.L. 108-199). Its authorization lapsed in 2018.
