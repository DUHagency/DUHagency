# How well does it follow AFCI
it doesnt at all bitch.  Cinnci by far the most.  Kristen Schlotman low key goated. I think because its a woman.  You hire the staff you want off the float loan.  She has the most staff by far.  I feel like men are more political.  No joke read aduits and files fr theyre 503.1c.  woman tend to stay at home, unless big excuse.  Men travel alot, eat out alot, dont give a fuck about mile perks and etc.

## John Daugherty

Director, Greater Columbus Film Commission (Film Columbus)

He is also an Emmy winning director and producer as well as a Billboard charting music producer.
John Daugherty has been a Columbus resident for over 30 years. A creative person and an entrepreneur at heart, John has always had an interest in film, music and the arts since an early age. His interest in growing the film community in Columbus from local production to feature film production to film festivals continues to prove his commitment to film and, most importantly, to the city of Columbus.

Since taking over as the Film Commissioner for central Ohio in 2015, the area has seen tremendous growth in the industry. Most notable was the expansion of the state tax credit from $20 million to $40 million in 2017.

In 2015, John facilitated the inaugural Columbus Film Summit at the request of then Mayor Michael B. Coleman. Through keynote speakers, panels, and general discussions, city leaders were presented with the fact that Columbus can sustain a true film industry. Also during 2015, the Film Commission redirected its efforts and its mission to grow and expand the film infrastructure in central Ohio focusing not only on production but exhibition and education as well.

John was a partner and Chief Creative Officer at the commercial and film production company Vital Film Works, now Vital Companies. He started the company with two business colleagues in 2007. John joined the Film Columbus board in 2013 and took over officially as Executive Director in March of 2015. His experience in the production world lends great benefit to being Director of Film Columbus. He is also an Emmy winning director and producer as well as a Billboard charting music producer.
