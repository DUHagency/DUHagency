# licenses

Vendor's License:  
A vendor's license is required in Ohio if you're selling tangible personal property, which includes produce. This license allows you to collect and remit sales tax on your sales.  
You can apply for a vendor's license online through the Ohio Business Gateway or by submitting a paper application to the Ohio Department of Taxation.

Food Establishment License:  
If you're selling unpackaged fruits and vegetables, you may need a Food Establishment License from the Ohio Department of Health. This license ensures compliance with food safety regulations and sanitary conditions.  
The requirements for a food establishment license may vary depending on the scale and nature of your operation. Contact your local health department for specific guidance.

Cottage Food Production Operation (CFPO) License:  
If you're selling certain types of non-hazardous foods, including certain types of produce, you may be eligible to operate as a Cottage Food Production Operation (CFPO) in Ohio.  
CFPOs are subject to less stringent regulations compared to commercial food establishments but still need to be registered with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and comply with labeling and food safety requirements.

Market Vendor Permit:  
If you're selling produce at farmers markets or other temporary locations, you may need to obtain a market vendor permit from the market organizer or local municipality.  
This permit authorizes you to set up a stall or booth at the designated market location and may have specific requirements regarding insurance, signage, and stall setup.

Organic Certification (Optional):  
If you're growing and selling organic produce, you may choose to pursue organic certification through the USDA National Organic Program (NOP).  
While organic certification is optional, it can enhance the marketability of your produce and demonstrate your commitment to organic farming practices.
