"Tax credits that cover the production costs for filming are just another way to maximize profits,
insulate against risk, and lower taxes, all while having little evidence to support significant new
economic activity created by these credits," said Sarah Austin, a tax analyst at the Maine Center
for Economic Policy, which opposes expanding the credits.
Other states are debating whether to scrap or adopt film tax credits. In some cases, the issue
has been framed around “Hollywood handouts” with the advocacy group Americans for
Prosperity funding efforts to eliminate credits mostly in states led by Republican governors,
including Maryland, North Carolina and Florida.

One was the 2015 romantic comedy “Tumbledown,” written by Portland filmmakers Desi Van Til
and Sean Mewshaw and set in Van Til’s hometown of Farmington.
Another recent movie set in Maine but filmed elsewhere, with a budget of about $4 million, was
the murky 2019 drama “The Lighthouse,” starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. It’s set on
a remote Maine island in the 1890s, and director Robert Eggers, a New Hampshire native, said
the dialogue was heavily influenced by the work of Maine writer Sarah Orne Jewett. The film
was shot in Nova Scotia, to take advantage of the tax rebate.

“This is about jobs, because most of the people working on a film set are carpenters or
electricians or caterers,”
Films that do get made in Maine often cost around $500,000 or less. Sometimes those are
made by people from Maine. One recent example is “Downeast,” a gritty crime story filmed in
Portland in 2020. It stars Scarborough native Greg Finley, a veteran Hollywood actor. Edwin
Stevens, the film’s cinematographer and a producer, is from Kennebunk originally.
