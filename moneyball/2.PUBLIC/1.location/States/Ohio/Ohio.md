## State Chapter
Due to the size, growing airport and politcal nature, Columbus Ohio will always be the State Chapter.

## National Chapter
This will be a Northeast free for all.  Sag Uion office proximity matters.  Airports matter.  Sports do not matter.  Economic incentive matters! This is Appalachia or rustbelt (Closet Union office is in [[Pittsburgh Pennsylvania]]).
