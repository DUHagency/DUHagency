# History of Naan
## Origin story
## Who eats in now

# Ingredients
- ▢ 1 teaspoon sugar
- ▢ 1/2 cup warm water
- ▢ 1/4 oz active dry yeast , 2 1/4 teaspoons
- ▢ 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ▢ 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- ▢ 1 teaspoon salt
- ▢ 1 tablespoon oil
- ▢ some oil , for greasing the skillet
- ▢ 3 tablespoons melted butter , or ghee
# Preparation
Alright, here’s how you start making naan: First, we’re going to **activate the yeast**. Grab a small bowl and mix together some sugar, warm water, and yeast. Give it a quick stir, then let it sit for about 10 minutes until it gets all foamy—that’s how you know the yeast is alive and kicking!

Meanwhile, place your flour on a flat surface and make a little well in the center—kind of like a crater. Now, pour in the yeast mixture, yogurt, salt, and oil. Start mixing and **kneading the dough** until it’s smooth and shiny—should take about 10 minutes. Once that’s done, cover it with a damp cloth and let it hang out in a warm spot, like near the stove or oven. In about an hour, it’ll puff up and double in size!

Now it’s time to **roll out the naan**! Divide the dough into 8 pieces, then grab a rolling pin and roll each one into a circle about 8 inches (20-cm) wide. It doesn’t have to be perfect—just try to keep it even.

For **cooking naan**, heat up a skillet (cast iron works great) on high and brush a little oil so the dough doesn’t stick. Place the dough in the skillet, and once it starts puffing up, bubbling, and getting some charred spots, flip it over to cook the other side. Keep doing that until all the dough is cooked!
