# **1. Types of Pan Breads**

Pan breads are baked in containers that shape and support the dough, yielding uniform loaves with soft crusts. Common varieties include:

- **Sandwich Loaves**: Classic white or whole wheat bread baked in loaf pans 26.
    
- **Pullman Loaves**: Rectangular, dense crumb (often made with bread flour) 3.
    
- **Brioche**: Enriched with butter and eggs, baked in pans for a tender texture 3.
    
- **Cornbread**: Baked in cast-iron skillets or square pans (uses cornmeal or corn flour) 12.
    
- **Focaccia**: Sheet-pan bread with olive oil and toppings 15.

# **2. Best Flours for Pan Breads**

The right flour ensures structure and softness:

- **Bread Flour** (12–14% protein): Ideal for sandwich loaves and brioche—creates chewiness 110.
    
- **All-Purpose Flour** (10–12% protein): Works for lighter loaves like milk bread 610.
    
- **Whole Wheat Flour**: Adds nuttiness but may require blending with white flour to avoid density 26.
    
- **White Whole Wheat Flour**: Milder flavor, easier to work with than traditional whole wheat 6.
    

**Pro Tip**: For enriched doughs (e.g., brioche), bread flour’s high protein supports added fats 3.

# **3. Key Techniques**

- **Pan Preparation**: Grease pans or line with parchment to prevent sticking.
    
- **Shaping**: Roll dough tightly for sandwich loaves to avoid gaps 2.
    
- **Proofing**: Let dough rise until just above the pan’s rim (overproofing causes collapse) 3.
    
- **Baking**:
    
    - **Temperature**: 350–375°F (175–190°C) for even baking.
        
    - **Doneness**: Internal temperature of 190–200°F (88–93°C) 6.

# **4. Recipe Adaptations**

- **Gluten-Free**: Use blends with xanthan gum for structure 12.
    
- **Sourdough Pan Bread**: Extend fermentation for flavor; reduce water slightly for better structure 10.
