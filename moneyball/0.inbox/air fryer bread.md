# **1. Wheat-Based Flours (Most Common for Bread)**

- **All-Purpose Flour** – A blend of hard and soft wheat; moderate protein (10-12%). Works for basic bread but may lack strength for artisanal loaves.
    
- **Bread Flour** – Higher protein (12-14%) from hard wheat; more gluten for chewy, structured bread (e.g., baguettes, sourdough).
    
- **Whole Wheat Flour** – Contains the entire wheat kernel (bran, germ, endosperm). Nutritious but dense; often mixed with white flour for better rise.
    
- **White Whole Wheat Flour** – Milder than traditional whole wheat, made from hard white wheat.
    
- **High-Gluten Flour** (14-15% protein) – Used for chewy bread like bagels or pizza dough.
    
- **Durum Wheat Flour (Semolina)** – Coarse, high-protein flour used in Italian bread (e.g., semolina bread) and pasta.
    

# **2. Ancient & Alternative Wheat Flours**

- **Spelt Flour** – Nutty flavor, moderate gluten (weaker than wheat), works in rustic breads.
    
- **Einkorn Flour** – One of the oldest wheat varieties; mild flavor, lower gluten (requires careful handling).
    
- **Emmer (Farro) Flour** – Earthy taste, used in traditional Italian and Middle Eastern breads.
    
- **Kamut® (Khorasan Wheat)** – Rich, buttery flavor; higher protein but less elastic gluten.
    

# **3. Gluten-Free Flours (Often Blended for Bread)**

- **Rye Flour** (Low-gluten) – Used in sourdough rye or pumpernickel (dense, tangy). Pure rye bread relies on sourdough fermentation.
    
- **Buckwheat Flour** – Gluten-free, earthy flavor; used in flatbreads or mixed with wheat.
    
- **Oat Flour** – Adds moisture and sweetness; usually combined with other flours.
    
- **Almond Flour** – Low-carb, gluten-free; requires eggs/binders for structure.
    
- **Rice Flour** (White/Brown) – Light texture; common in gluten-free blends.
    
- **Sorghum Flour** – Mild, nutritious; used in gluten-free bread mixes.
    
- **Tapioca/Cassava Flour** – Chewy texture; helps bind gluten-free doughs.
    

# **4. Specialty Flours**

- **Rye Flour** (Light/Dark/Pumpernickel) – Varies by milling; dark rye has more bran for intense flavor.
    
- **Malt Flour/Diastatic Malt** – Enhances yeast activity and browning (common in bagels).
    
- **Sprouted Grain Flour** – Made from sprouted wheat or other grains; sweeter, easier to digest.
