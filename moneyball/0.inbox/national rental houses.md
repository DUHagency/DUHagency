- **Nationwide/Global**: A.A. Rental (US) and NEP offer cross-country shipping, while Sunbelt/Adlib cover Europe .  
- **Live Broadcast**: NEP and Camaleón provide turnkey solutions with CCU-controlled cameras and fiber optics .  

For specific gear (e.g., RED cameras), check Lensrentals or NEP for pro-grade options. Event-focused needs may align better with Adlib or A.A. Rental.
