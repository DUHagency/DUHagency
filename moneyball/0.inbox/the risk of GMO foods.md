## **1. Most Common GMO Foods in Human Diets**

### **A. Staple Crops**

1. **Corn (92% GMO in U.S.)**:
    
    - Used in corn syrup, cornstarch, and animal feed 1710.
        
    - Bt corn produces insecticidal proteins but is deemed safe for human consumption 1.
        
2. **Soybeans (94% GMO)**:
    
    - Found in soybean oil, tofu, and processed foods (e.g., veggie burgers, cereals) 710.
        
    - Engineered for herbicide tolerance (Roundup Ready) 4.
        
3. **Canola (95% GMO)**:
    
    - Oil used in margarine, packaged foods, and frying 410.
        
4. **Sugar Beets (99.9% GMO)**:
    
    - Source of ~50% of U.S. granulated sugar 17.
        

### **B. Fruits & Vegetables**

5. **Papaya (90% GMO in Hawaii)**:
    
    - Rainbow papaya resists ringspot virus 17.
        
6. **Potatoes**:
    
    - Modified to resist bruising and reduce acrylamide (a potential carcinogen) 710.
        
7. **Summer Squash/Zucchini**:
    
    - Engineered to resist mosaic viruses 14.
        
8. **Apples (Arctic® varieties)**:
    
    - Non-browning trait reduces food waste 710.
        

### **C. Indirect Consumption**

9. **Animal Products**:
    
    - Over 95% of U.S. livestock eat GMO feed (corn, soy, alfalfa) 14.
        
10. **Processed Foods**:
    
    - Derivatives like high-fructose corn syrup, soy lecithin, and canola oil are ubiquitous 710.

## **2. Extreme Risks of Roundup-Tolerant Crops**

### **A. Health Risks**

- **Glyphosate Residues**:
    
    - Found in 90% of soybeans and linked to kidney/liver damage in animal studies 58.
        
    - Classified as "probably carcinogenic" (Group 2A) by IARC 8.
        
- **Endocrine Disruption**:
    
    - Roundup formulants (e.g., petroleum residues, heavy metals) are 1000x more toxic than glyphosate alone, affecting hormone systems 58.
        
- **Antibiotic Resistance**:
    
    - GMO crops with antibiotic marker genes could transfer resistance to gut bacteria 6.
        

### **B. Environmental Risks**

- **Superweeds**:
    
    - Overuse of Roundup has led to glyphosate-resistant weeds, forcing higher herbicide use 28.
        
- **Soil & Water Contamination**:
    
    - Glyphosate persists in soil/water, harming biodiversity and aquatic life 85.
        
- **Loss of Biodiversity**:
    
    - Monoculture farming of Roundup-ready crops reduces pollinator habitats 69.
        

### **C. Regulatory Failures**

- **Industry Influence**:
    
    - Regulators often assess only glyphosate, ignoring toxic formulants (e.g., POEA) 28.
        
    - Conflicts of interest: Monsanto/Bayer ghostwrote studies dismissing risks 5.
        
- **Food Chain Contamination**:
    
    - Control groups in safety studies were fed GMO-contaminated feed, skewing results 5.

## **3. Key Takeaways**

- **Labeling**: USDA requires "bioengineered" labels, but loopholes exist (e.g., highly processed ingredients) 19.
    
- **Alternatives**: Organic or Non-GMO Project Verified foods reduce exposure 410.
