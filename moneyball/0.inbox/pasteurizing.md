## **1. What is Pasteurization?**

Pasteurization heats food to a specific temperature (below boiling) to kill harmful pathogens while preserving flavor and texture. Unlike canning, it’s typically used for short-term preservation or pre-treatment.

**Common Uses**:

- Dairy (milk, cheese) [1](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/dangers-raw-milk-unpasteurized-milk-can-pose-serious-health-risk)
    
- Juices/ciders [2](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/pasteurizing_juice.html)
    
- Eggs (for recipes like mayo) [3](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/eggs/egg-products-and-food-safety)

## **2. Methods**

### **A. Liquid Foods (Milk, Juice)**

1. **Stovetop Method**:
    
    - Heat to **161°F (72°C)** for **15 seconds** (or **145°F/63°C** for 30 mins for milder taste) [4](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/home-pasteurization.html).
        
    - Use a thermometer; stir to avoid scorching.
        
    - Cool rapidly in an ice bath.
        
2. **Microwave Pasteurization** (for small batches):
    
    - Heat juice to **160°F (71°C)**, hold for **6 seconds** [5](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/pasteurizing_juice.html).
        

### **B. Eggs (In-Shell)**

- Submerge in **140°F (60°C)** water for **3.5 minutes** to kill Salmonella [6](https://extension.umn.edu/preserving-and-preparing/pasteurizing-eggs-home).
    

### **C. Beer/Wine (Home Brewing)**

- Heat to **145–160°F (63–71°C)** for **30 minutes** [7](https://extension.psu.edu/pasteurization-of-home-preserved-foods).

## **3. Safety Notes**

- **Not a Substitute for Canning**: Pasteurized foods must be refrigerated and used within days (unless further processed) [8](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/2009/mar/100201.htm).
    
- **Acidify Juices** (pH ≤ 4.6) for longer shelf life [9](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/pasteurizing_juice.html).

## **4. Troubleshooting**

- **Off Flavors**: Overheating dairy can cause caramelization.
    
- **Spoilage**: Discard if cloudy, bubbly, or foul-smelling [10](https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/food-safety-during-power-outage).
