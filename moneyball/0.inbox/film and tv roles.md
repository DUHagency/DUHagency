## **Gray Areas & Exceptions**

- **Cinematographers & Editors** – Sometimes considered ATL if they have major creative influence.

## **Why It Matters**

- **Budgeting:** ATL costs are fixed early; BTL is flexible.
    
- **Credits:** ATL roles appear first in film/TV credits.
    
- **Unions/Contracts:** ATL often negotiates individually; BTL follows union scales.
