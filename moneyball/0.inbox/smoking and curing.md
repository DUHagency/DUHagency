## **1. What is Sugar Curing?**

Sugar curing is a preservation method that uses sugar (often combined with salt or acids) to draw moisture out of food via osmosis, creating an environment hostile to microbial growth. It enhances flavor, texture, and shelf life [1](https://www.sugarnutritionresource.org/news-articles/sugar-as-a-preservative)6.

**Key Uses**:

- **Fruits**: Jams, jellies, candied fruits [2](https://www.sugar.org/blog/real-sugar-and-salt-effective-and-all-natural-food-preservatives/).
    
- **Meats**: Sugar-cured hams, bacon (combined with salt) [3](https://www.bradleysmoker.com/blogs/articles-tips-tricks/what-is-curing-why-and-how-to-do-it).
    
- **Fermented Foods**: Sauerkraut, kimchi (sugar feeds beneficial bacteria) [4](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/fermenting.html).

## **2. Methods of Sugar Curing**

### **A. Dry Sugar Curing**

- **Process**: Coat food in granulated sugar (or mix with salt/spices).
    
- **Best for**: Fruits (candied citrus peels), some meats (e.g., brown sugar-cured bacon) [5](https://www.escoffieronline.com/dry-vs-wet-how-to-cure-any-cut-of-meat/).
    
- **Ratio**: Typically **1 part sugar to 3 parts salt** for meats [6](https://www.meatcrafters.com/blogs/meatcrafters-blog/the-art-of-curing-meats).
    

### **B. Sugar Brining (Wet Curing)**

- **Process**: Dissolve sugar in water (with salt/acid) to create a syrup or brine.
    
- **Best for**: Fruits (preserved in syrup), poultry (e.g., honey-brined turkey) [7](https://www.sugarnutritionresource.org/news-articles/sugar-as-a-preservative).
    
- **Example Brine**: **1 cup sugar + 1 gallon water + ½ cup salt** [8](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/cure_smoke/wet_curing.html).
    

### **C. Fermentation with Sugar**

- **Role**: Sugar feeds _Lactobacillus_ bacteria, producing lactic acid for preservation (e.g., kimchi, sauerkraut) [9](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/fermenting.html).

## **3. Foods Suitable for Sugar Curing**

|**Food**|**Method**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fruits**|Dry or syrup brine|Jams, candied fruits, preserved lemons [10](https://www.sugar.org/blog/real-sugar-and-salt-effective-and-all-natural-food-preservatives/).|
|**Meats**|Dry/sugar-salt mix|Bacon, ham (sugar balances salt harshness) [11](https://www.bradleysmoker.com/blogs/articles-tips-tricks/what-is-curing-why-and-how-to-do-it).|
|**Vegetables**|Fermentation|Sauerkraut (sugar accelerates fermentation) [12](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/fermenting.html).|

## **4. Safety & Best Practices**

- **Acidification**: Combine sugar with vinegar/lemon juice for safer fruit preserves (pH ≤ 4.6) [13](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/pickled_fruits.html).
    
- **Storage**: Sugar-cured foods must be refrigerated or canned for long-term storage [14](https://www.sugarnutritionresource.org/news-articles/sugar-as-a-preservative).
    
- **Avoid Substitutes**: Artificial sweeteners lack preservative properties [15](https://www.sugarnutritionresource.org/news-articles/sugar-as-a-preservative).

## **5. Health Considerations**

- **Botulism Risk**: Sugar alone doesn’t prevent _C. botulinum_; combine with salt/acid for meats [16](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/cure_smoke/food_safety.html).
    
- **Moderation**: High sugar intake linked to health issues; balance with dietary needs [17](https://www.sugar.org/blog/real-sugar-and-salt-effective-and-all-natural-food-preservatives/).

## **6. Resources**

- **UGA Fermentation Guide**: [18](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/fermenting.html).
    
- **Sugar Preservation Science**: [19](https://www.sugarnutritionresource.org/news-articles/sugar-as-a-preservative).

**Key Insight**: Sugar curing is ideal for fruits and fermented foods, while meats require **salt-sugar blends** for safety. Always follow tested recipes [20](https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications_usda.html).
