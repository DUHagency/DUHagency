### **What is GRAS in Foods?**

**GRAS ("Generally Recognized as Safe")** is a U.S. FDA designation for food additives or ingredients that are exempt from formal premarket approval because they are deemed safe by "qualified experts" based on long-term use or scientific evidence 17. Established in 1958, the GRAS system allows manufacturers to self-certify ingredients without FDA review, though voluntary notifications can be submitted 1011.

### **Why GRAS is Controversial and Potentially Dangerous**

1. **Lack of Independent FDA Oversight**
    
    - Companies can **self-determine GRAS status** without FDA approval, relying on internal or industry-funded studies. The FDA reviews only about 20% of GRAS submissions voluntarily sent by manufacturers 1011.
        
    - Example: **Trans fats** were GRAS for decades before being banned in 2015 due to heart disease risks 10.
        
2. **Conflicts of Interest**
    
    - GRAS determinations are often made by **industry-paid experts**, raising concerns about bias. A 2013 study found that all 451 GRAS notifications reviewed by the FDA were submitted by employees or consultants of the manufacturer 1011.
        
3. **Cumulative Exposure Risks Ignored**
    
    - GRAS assessments typically evaluate single ingredients, not **combined effects** of multiple additives (e.g., emulsifiers, preservatives) in processed foods. For instance, carrageenan (a GRAS thickener) is linked to gut inflammation in studies but remains widely used 108.
        
4. **Loopholes for Novel Ingredients**
    
    - Synthetic chemicals or **bioengineered substances** (e.g., certain GMO-derived proteins) can bypass rigorous safety reviews by claiming GRAS status. The FDA does not require long-term animal testing for these ingredients 79.
        
5. **Allergen and Toxicity Risks**
    
    - Some GRAS substances, like **soy leghemoglobin** (used in Impossible Burgers), triggered allergic reactions in early trials but were approved without extensive allergen testing 11.
        
    - Heavy metals (e.g., lead in food colorings) may also slip through due to lax thresholds 11.
        

### **Recent Reforms and Ongoing Issues**

- The FDA’s 2024 **Human Foods Program** proposed stricter oversight of GRAS additives, but industry lobbying has delayed implementation 11.
    
- Critics argue GRAS should be replaced with **mandatory premarket approval** for all additives, similar to the EU’s system 108.
    

**Key Takeaway**: GRAS prioritizes industry convenience over consumer safety, allowing potentially harmful ingredients into foods without robust independent review. For safer choices, opt for whole foods and check labels for additives like "natural flavors" or "stabilizers," which often hide GRAS chemicals 1011.
