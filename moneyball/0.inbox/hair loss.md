The primary reason 96% of men experience hair loss is due to male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, which is largely influenced by genetic factors and hormonal changes, particularly the effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on hair follicles. This condition typically becomes more common as men age, with significant thinning or loss often starting in their 20s or 30s.[![](https://duckduckgo.com/assets/icons/favicons/wikipedia.white.2x.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss)
More than 50% of women will experience noticeable hair loss at some point in their lives, and approximately 80% of women will have some signs of thinning hair by age 80. The most common type of hair loss in women is female pattern hair loss, affecting about 30 million women in the U.S.[![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/ip3/www.nebraskamed.com.ico)](https://www.nebraskamed.com/dermatology/hair-loss-in-women-what-causes-it-and-how-to-stop-it)


Recent research suggests that a naturally occurring sugar called 2-deoxy-D-ribose may stimulate hair regrowth in mice, showing effectiveness similar to existing treatments like minoxidil. This discovery offers hope for new, potentially inexpensive treatments for male pattern baldness, although further research is needed to confirm its effects in humans
