## **1. Understanding Canning Basics**

Canning preserves food by heating jars to destroy microorganisms and enzymes, then sealing them to prevent recontamination. Two primary methods:

- **Water Bath Canning**: For high-acid foods (pH ≤ 4.6) like fruits, jams, pickles, and tomatoes (with added acid) [1](https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications_usda.html).
    
- **Pressure Canning**: Required for low-acid foods (pH > 4.6) like vegetables, meats, and seafood to kill botulism spores [2](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_01/pressure_can.html).
    

**Safety Note**: Never substitute methods—low-acid foods _must_ be pressure-canned [3](https://www.clemson.edu/extension/food/canning/canning-tips/07botulism.html).

## **2. Essential Equipment**

- **Jars & Lids**: Use tempered glass jars (e.g., Mason jars) and new two-piece lids [4](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/equipment.html).
    
- **Canners**:
    
    - Water bath canner for high-acid foods [5](https://extension.umn.edu/preserving-and-preparing/water-bath-canning).
        
    - Pressure canner (with gauge) for low-acid foods [6](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_01/pressure_canners.html).
        

**Pro Tip**: Test pressure canner gauges annually [7](https://extension.psu.edu/testing-pressure-canner-gauges).

## **3. Preparing Food**

- **Select Fresh Produce**: Avoid overripe items [8](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/select_products.html).
    
- **Acidification**: Add lemon juice to tomatoes for safe water bath canning [9](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_03/tomato_acidification.html).
    

**Packing Methods**:

- **Raw Pack**: Fill jars with uncooked food [10](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/fill_jars_raw.html).
    
- **Hot Pack**: Pre-cook food to shrink it [11](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/fill_jars_hot.html).

## **4. Step-by-Step Canning**

### **Water Bath Canning**:

1. Sterilize jars (if processing <10 minutes) [12](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/boiling_water_process.html).
    
2. Leave proper headspace (½ inch for fruits) [13](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/headspace.html).
    

### **Pressure Canning**:

1. Process at 10–15 psi per food type [14](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_01/pressure_can.html).
    

**Storage**: Label jars and store in a cool place [15](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/storing.html).

## **5. Safety & Troubleshooting**

- **Botulism Prevention**: Follow USDA recipes [16](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/ipd/canning/about).
    
- **Spoilage Signs**: Discard bulging lids [17](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/general/detect_spoilage.html).
