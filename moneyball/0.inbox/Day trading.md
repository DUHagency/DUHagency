# **1. Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule**

- **Current Requirement**:
    
    - If you execute **4+ day trades** (buying/selling the same security in one day) within **5 business days** in a **margin account**, you’re flagged as a PDT.
        
    - Must maintain a **minimum equity of $25,000** in the account at all times to continue day trading 479.
        
    - If the account falls below $25K, you’re restricted to closing trades only until the balance is restored 9.
        
- **Proposed Change (2025)**:
    
    - FINRA is considering lowering the minimum equity requirement from **$25,000 to $2,000** and removing the 4-trade limit 13.
        
    - Brokerages could set their own minimums (e.g., $2K), but the rule is pending SEC approval (likely late 2025/early 2026) 3.

## **2. Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts**

- **Cash Accounts**:
    
    - No PDT restrictions, but you’re limited by **settled funds** (T+2 for stocks).
        
    - Violating this (e.g., selling before funds settle) triggers a **90-day free-riding restriction** 910.
        
- **Margin Accounts**:
    
    - Subject to PDT rules.
        
    - **Day-trading buying power** is capped at **4x** your maintenance margin excess 7.

## **3. Consequences of Violating PDT Rules**

- **90-day trading restriction**: Only allowed to trade with settled cash 49.
    
- **Margin calls**: Must deposit funds within **5 business days** to restore the $25K minimum 7.

## **4. Brokerage-Specific Rules**

- Some brokers (e.g., Schwab) enforce stricter "house requirements" or offer one-time exceptions for accidental PDT violations 4.
    
- Platforms like Robinhood may restrict accounts faster due to risk management 3.

## **5. Key Risks & Alternatives**

- **High risk**: Studies show most retail day traders lose money 1011.
    
- **Alternatives**: Swing trading (no PDT rules) or using cash accounts with settled funds 10.
