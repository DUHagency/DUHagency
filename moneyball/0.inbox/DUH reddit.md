1. **Multireddits (Custom Feeds)** – Users can create custom feeds that group multiple subreddits together, but these are personal collections, not official hierarchies.
    
2. **Related Subreddits Sidebar Links** – Many subreddits list "sister" or related communities in their sidebar to guide users to more niche topics.
    
3. **Tags/Flairs** – Some larger subreddits use post flairs to categorize content into subtopics (e.g., `r/AskReddit` uses flairs like "Serious," "AMA," etc.).
    
4. **Wiki Pages/Discord Servers** – Subreddits may link to external wikis, Discord servers, or other platforms for deeper organization.
