# synopsis
### **1. Soybeans**

- **Why?** Over **90% of U.S. soybeans** are genetically modified to be "Roundup Ready," allowing direct spraying during growth. Glyphosate is often applied pre-harvest as a desiccant to dry crops faster, increasing residue levels 79.
    
- **Residue Levels**: FDA tests detected glyphosate in **67% of soybean samples**, with some exceeding EPA thresholds 9.
    

### **2. Corn (Maize)**

- **Why?** Like soybeans, **~90% of U.S. corn** is Roundup Ready. Glyphosate is used post-emergence and sometimes pre-harvest 79.
    
- **Residue Levels**: Found in **55% of tested corn samples**, though typically below EPA limits 9.
    

### **3. Canola (Rapeseed)**

- **Why?** Widely grown as a Roundup Ready crop, especially in Canada. Glyphosate is applied to control weeds and accelerate drying 7.
    
- **Residue Levels**: High residues in oilseeds due to direct spraying; EPA raised allowable limits in 2013 9.
    

### **4. Cotton**

- **Why?** Roundup Ready cotton is common in the U.S. and India. Glyphosate is used for weed control, and residues may remain in cottonseed oil 79.
    

### **5. Sugar Beets**

- **Why?** Nearly all U.S. sugar beets are Roundup Ready. Heavy glyphosate use leads to detectable residues in refined sugar 79.
    

### **6. Oats**

- **Why?** Not genetically modified, but glyphosate is often sprayed pre-harvest as a desiccant.
    
- **Residue Levels**: FDA found glyphosate in **43% of oat samples**, including oatmeal and cereals 9.
    

### **7. Wheat**

- **Why?** While not Roundup Ready, glyphosate is sometimes used pre-harvest (especially in North America) to manage weeds and speed drying 9.
    
- **Residue Levels**: Detected in **30% of wheat samples**, though usually at low levels 9.
    

### **8. Alfalfa**

- **Why?** Roundup Ready alfalfa is grown for livestock feed. Glyphosate residues may transfer to dairy/meat products 7.
    

### **9. Lentils and Peas**

- **Why?** Glyphosate is occasionally used as a pre-harvest desiccant, leading to residues in legumes 9.
    

### **10. Fruits (Oranges, Grapes, Apples)**

- **Why?** Glyphosate is used in orchards for weed control. Residues are found on skins, though peeling reduces exposure 9.

### **Key Factors Influencing Residue Levels**

1. **Pre-Harvest Desiccation**: Crops like oats, wheat, and lentils often have higher residues due to late-season spraying 9.
    
2. **Genetic Modification**: Roundup Ready crops (soy, corn, canola) are sprayed more frequently 7.
    
3. **Processing**: Residues may concentrate in oils (soybean, canola) or sugars (from beets) 9.

### **Health and Regulatory Notes**

- **EPA Limits**: The U.S. allows higher glyphosate residues than the EU (e.g., **15x more on sweet potatoes**) 9.
    
- **Controversy**: The WHO’s IARC classifies glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic," while the EPA maintains it’s safe at current levels 9.
