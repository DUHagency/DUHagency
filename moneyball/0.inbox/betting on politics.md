# **Key Considerations**

- **Legality**: Politicians must disclose trades within 45 days, but delays occur 67.
    
- **Bias**: White House data may emphasize partisan achievements 4.
    
- **Risk**: Following political trades doesn’t guarantee returns (see Quiver’s 24.6% max drawdown) 6.
    

For **global sovereign funds** (e.g., Norway’s $1.4T oil fund), check [NBIM](https://www.nbim.no/) 14. Let me know if you’d like deeper analysis on a specific dataset!
