## **1. What is Vacuum Packing?**

Vacuum packing removes air from food packaging to extend shelf life by slowing oxidation and microbial growth. Unlike canning, it **does not kill pathogens** and requires refrigeration/freezing for perishable foods [1](https://nchfp.uga.edu/resources/entry/should-i-vacuum-package-food-at-home)2.

**Key Uses**:

- **Meats/Fish**: Prevent freezer burn; extends freezer life 3–5× [2](https://extension.umaine.edu/food-health/2024/09/03/vacuum-sealing/)7.
    
- **Dry Goods**: Nuts, crackers (prevents staleness) [3](https://extension.umn.edu/preserving-and-preparing/vacuum-sealing-food-home-safely)8.
    
- **Meal Prep**: Portion and store cooked meals [4](https://www.foodvacuumsealers.com.au/blogs/vacuum-sealing-food-items)9.

## **2. Benefits of Vacuum Packing**

- **Extended Shelf Life**:
    
    - Freezer meats last 2–3 years vs. 6 months conventionally [5](https://www.firstfoodmachinery.co.uk/blog/19778-the-benefits-of-vacuum-packing-food)10.
        
    - Cheese lasts 4–8 months refrigerated vs. 1–2 weeks [6](https://vacpac.com.au/top-15-benefits-of-vacuum-sealing-your-food-2/)12.
        
- **Prevents Freezer Burn**: Blocks air contact with food [7](https://www.fns.usda.gov/fs/produce-safety/vacuum-seal)10.
    
- **Space Efficiency**: Removes air to reduce bulk [8](https://la-va.com/en/magazin/why-should-you-vacuum-seal-food-and-what-are-the-benefits/)16.

## **3. Safety Risks & Precautions**

- **Botulism Risk**: Low-oxygen environments favor _C. botulinum_ growth in perishables. **Always refrigerate/freeze** vacuum-packed meats/fish [9](https://nchfp.uga.edu/resources/entry/should-i-vacuum-package-food-at-home)2.
    
- **Thawing Safely**: For fish, remove from vacuum bag before thawing to prevent botulism [10](https://extension.umaine.edu/food-health/2024/09/03/vacuum-sealing/)7.
    
- **Clean Handling**: Sanitize tools and wash hands to avoid contamination [11](https://extension.umn.edu/preserving-and-preparing/vacuum-sealing-food-home-safely)8.

## **4. Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Choose Equipment**:
    
    - Budget models (~$50) for dry goods; commercial-grade for liquids [12](https://extension.umaine.edu/food-health/2024/09/03/vacuum-sealing/)7.
        
2. **Prepare Food**:
    
    - Pat dry meats/fish to improve seal [13](https://www.foodvacuumsealers.com.au/blogs/vacuum-sealing-food-items)9.
        
3. **Seal**:
    
    - Use "moist" setting for wet foods; label with date [14](https://extension.umn.edu/preserving-and-preparing/vacuum-sealing-food-home-safely)8.
        
4. **Store**:
    
    - Freeze at 0°F (-18°C) or refrigerate below 40°F (4°C) [15](https://nchfp.uga.edu/resources/entry/should-i-vacuum-package-food-at-home)2.

## **5. Foods to Avoid Vacuum Packing**

- **Soft Fruits/Vegetables**: Crushed by pressure (e.g., strawberries) [16](https://www.foodvacuumsealers.com.au/blogs/vacuum-sealing-food-items)9.
    
- **Raw Mushrooms/Garlic**: Risk of botulism in anaerobic conditions [17](https://nchfp.uga.edu/resources/entry/should-i-vacuum-package-food-at-home)2.

- **UMaine Step-by-Step**: [19](https://extension.umaine.edu/food-health/2024/09/03/vacuum-sealing/)7.
    

**Pro Tip**: For liquids (soups), freeze first before sealing to avoid machine damage [20](https://vacpac.com.au/top-15-benefits-of-vacuum-sealing-your-food-2/)12.
