# Best Flours for Skillet Breads

- **Bread Flour** (for chewy yeast breads)
- **All-Purpose Flour** (versatile for most recipes)
- **Cornmeal** (essential for cornbread)
- **Whole Wheat Flour** (for nuttier, denser breads)    
- **Self-Rising Flour** (for quick breads like soda bread)
# Essential Techniques

✔ **Preheat the Skillet** – A hot skillet ensures a crispy bottom crust.  
✔ **Use Enough Fat** – Butter, oil, or bacon grease prevents sticking and adds flavor.  
✔ **Control Heat** – Medium heat for flatbreads, high heat for crusty loaves.  
✔ **Cover for Steam** (optional) – Traps moisture for a softer crumb.
