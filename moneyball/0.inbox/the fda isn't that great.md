The **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** plays a critical role in safeguarding public health, but systemic failures have repeatedly compromised its ability to protect American consumers. Here’s a breakdown of key shortcomings, supported by recent investigations and expert analyses:

---

### **1. Prioritizing Speed Over Safety in Drug Approvals**

- **Conflict of Interest**: The FDA relies heavily on **"user fees"** from pharmaceutical companies (projected at **$3 billion in 2023**), creating pressure to fast-track drug approvals. This has led to **18% more adverse reactions**, **11% more hospitalizations**, and **7.2% more deaths** linked to inadequately tested drugs 1.
    
- **Low Efficacy Standards**: Only **11–15% of new drugs** approved between 2002–2011 offered significant clinical advantages over existing treatments, with most being "me-too" drugs 1.
    
- **Opioid Crisis Failures**: The FDA ignored its own advisors to approve **Dsuvia** (a potent fentanyl variant) and failed to correct misleading OxyContin labeling claiming "reduced abuse liability" for years, exacerbating the opioid epidemic 111.
    

---

### **2. Lax Oversight of Food Safety**

- **Delayed Responses to Contamination**: The FDA took **5 months** to recall infant formula linked to bacterial infections (including 2 deaths) after initial reports, and **4 years** to act on heavy metals in baby food despite early warnings 13.
    
- **Underfunded and Understaffed**: The food division receives **<15% of the FDA’s budget** ($1 billion of $8.4 billion), leading to **fewer inspections** and reliance on outdated tools. A POLITICO investigation found inspectors often miss violations due to "antiquated standards" 13.
    
- **Prevention Failures**: The **2011 Food Safety Modernization Act** mandated produce water safety standards, but the FDA still hasn’t implemented them, contributing to recurring outbreaks (e.g., **listeria in cantaloupes**, **E. coli in spinach**) 36.
    

---

### **3. Ignoring Cumulative Health Risks from Food Chemicals**

- **Toxic Additives**: The FDA allows **self-certification** of food chemicals as "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS), with **876 of 877 GRAS notices** failing to assess cumulative effects of related toxins (e.g., nitrates, perchlorate) that harm thyroid function and brain development 7.
    
- **Heavy Metals in Food**: No enforceable limits exist for **lead, arsenic, or cadmium** in baby food, despite evidence linking them to developmental disorders 612.
    

---

### **4. Organizational Dysfunction**

- **Leadership Instability**: The FDA has had **5 commissioners in 4 years**, with food safety often deprioritized. Former officials describe the food division as "broken" and "a joke" 312.
    
- **Regulatory Capture**: Corporate lobbying has weakened premarket reviews, with **68% of drugs** now approved via expedited pathways lacking rigorous safety checks 11.
    

---

### **5. Transparency and Accountability Gaps**

- **Slow Recalls**: The FDA’s recall process is reactive and opaque. For example, it took **months** to classify recalls of contaminated infant formula and baby food, leaving consumers uninformed 412.
    
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Manufacturers like **Ningbo Huize** falsified drug safety records, yet the FDA’s enforcement is inconsistent, allowing adulterated products to reach markets 10.
    

---

### **Proposed Reforms** 61112

1. **Increase Funding**: Allocate more resources to food safety inspections and modernize testing tools.
    
2. **Enforce Cumulative Risk Assessments**: Mandate evaluations of combined chemical exposures in food.
    
3. **Restore Premarket Authority**: Limit fast-track drug approvals and close loopholes like GRAS self-certification.
    
4. **Improve Transparency**: Publish **complete response letters** for rejected drugs and streamline recall notifications.
    
5. **Structural Overhaul**: Separate food and drug divisions to reduce conflicts of interest.

No, **dietary supplement companies cannot obtain FDA approval** for their products under current U.S. regulations, as the FDA **does not approve dietary supplements** for safety or effectiveness before they are marketed. Here’s why and how the system works:

### **1. FDA Does Not Approve Supplements Before Sale**

Under the **Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994**, supplements are regulated as a category of **food**, not drugs. This means:

- **No premarket approval** is required (unlike drugs, which must undergo rigorous clinical trials) 15.
    
- Companies are responsible for ensuring their products are safe and properly labeled, but they **do not need FDA clearance** to sell them 36.
    

### **2. Exceptions Where FDA Gets Involved**

While the FDA doesn’t "approve" supplements, it does enforce certain rules:

- **New Dietary Ingredients (NDIs)**: If a supplement contains an ingredient not marketed before 1994, the company must submit a safety notification to the FDA **75 days before selling it** (though the FDA doesn’t "approve" it) 110.
    
- **Adulterated or Misbranded Products**: The FDA can take action against supplements that are unsafe, mislabeled, or make illegal drug claims (e.g., "cures cancer") 313.
    
- **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)**: Facilities must follow FDA GMP guidelines to ensure quality, but compliance is monitored through inspections, not pre-approval 1011.
    

### **3. Why Companies Can’t Seek FDA Approval (Even If They Want To)**

- **Legal Classification**: Supplements are **not drugs**, so they cannot go through the FDA’s drug-approval process unless the company rebrands them as such (which requires clinical trials) 89.
    
- **No Pathway for "Supplement Approval"**: The FDA has no mechanism to evaluate supplements for efficacy like it does for medications. Structure/function claims (e.g., "supports immunity") are allowed, but **disease-treatment claims are prohibited** 69.
    

### **4. What Companies Can Do to Build Trust**

Though they can’t get FDA approval, reputable companies often:

- **Voluntarily test products** with third-party verifiers (e.g., USP, NSF, ConsumerLab) 11.
    
- **Comply with GMPs** and FDA labeling rules to avoid warnings or recalls 10.
    
- **Submit NDIs** for novel ingredients to demonstrate safety 1.
    

### **5. Key Risks for Consumers**

- **No Guarantee of Safety or Efficacy**: Unlike drugs, supplements may not work as claimed or could contain harmful contaminants 1113.
    
- **Misleading Marketing**: Some companies imply "FDA approval" by using terms like "FDA-registered facility" (which only means the factory is listed, not that the product is approved) 213.
    

### **Bottom Line**

Supplement companies **cannot** get FDA approval for their products under current law. The system relies on **post-market enforcement**, meaning the FDA steps in only after problems arise. For safer choices, consumers should:

- Look for **third-party certifications** (e.g., USP, NSF).
    
- Consult healthcare providers before use 56.
    
- Report adverse events to the FDA via [MedWatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch) 5.
