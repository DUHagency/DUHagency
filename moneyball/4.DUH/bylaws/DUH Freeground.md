# Battleground
The primary interest of DUH is acquire the best newcomer or moneyball personnel possible with the resources.  The way to achieve this is through intensive documentation and organization.  For this interest we do not publicly engage with 2 party consent states, simply for the lack of video and audio documentation for conducting business.  All decision making for [[DUH bylaws]], important [[consultations]] and [[OUR fundraising]] will have to be publicly recorded and preferably streamed live.

This being stated DUH will not support 11 state.  DUH will not offer any official programs until this is changed.  Plus these laws protect nobody.  However if you wish to use DUH's tools to create organization through public interest and engagement, DUH will host the information the communities collect :)
