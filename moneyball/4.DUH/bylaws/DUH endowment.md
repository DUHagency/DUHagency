## **1. Build a Strong Local Case**

- **Document the Community Need:**  
    Gather reliable data showing the size and growth of the Nepali and Bhutanese communities in Columbus. Highlight that Columbus is home to the largest Bhutanese-Nepali expatriate community in the U.S., and possibly the world outside South Asia.
    
- **Collect Testimonials and Support Letters:**  
    Obtain endorsements from community leaders, local government officials, business groups, and organizations serving the Nepali and Bhutanese populations.
