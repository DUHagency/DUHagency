# publishing
## **1. Obsidian Publish (Official Solution)**

✅ **Pros:**

- Easiest method (one-click publishing).
    
- Maintains links, backlinks, and basic formatting.
    
- Supports version history and private pages.
    
- Good for non-technical users.
    

❌ **Cons:**

- Expensive ($20/month for 1 site, $50/month for 5 sites).
    
- Limited customization (themes, layouts, interactivity).
    
- No dynamic features (search, comments, forms) without workarounds.
    

🔹 **Best for:** Non-technical users who want a simple, hassle-free way to publish notes.

## **2. Free/Cheaper Alternatives (More Control, More Work)**

### **A. Static Site Generators (SSG)**

Convert your Obsidian notes into a static website using tools like:

- **Obsidian → MkDocs + Material Theme** (via `obsidian-export` or `obsidian-md`)
    
- **Obsidian → Hugo** (with plugins like `obsidian-to-hugo`)
    
- **Obsidian → Quartz** (designed for Obsidian, supports backlinks, search, and dark mode)
    

✅ **Pros:**

- **Free** (host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
    
- **Fully customizable** (CSS, JavaScript, plugins).
    
- **Dynamic features** (search, comments via Disqus, analytics).
    

❌ **Cons:**

- Requires setup (Markdown cleanup, YAML frontmatter).
    
- Backlinks/graph may need extra configuration.
    

🔹 **Best for:** Tech-savvy users who want full control and free hosting.

### **B. Self-Hosted Wiki (Dynamic Database)**

- **Wiki.js** (import Obsidian notes via Markdown)
    
- **Docusaurus** (supports React-based interactivity)
    
- **TiddlyWiki** (single-file wiki, can integrate Obsidian)
    

✅ **Pros:**

- Database-driven (search, user accounts, dynamic content).
    
- More interactive than static sites.
    

❌ **Cons:**

- Needs a server (VPS, Docker, or cloud hosting).
    
- More complex setup.
    

🔹 **Best for:** Users who need a true dynamic wiki with user interactions.

## **3. Hybrid Approach (Obsidian + Web App)**

- Use **Obsidian Sync** ($10/month) + a static site generator.
    
- Sync notes to GitHub → Auto-deploy via Netlify/Vercel.
    
- Add **comments** (via Staticman, Giscus) or **search** (Algolia, Pagefind).

## **Recommendation:**

- **If you want zero hassle → Obsidian Publish** (but expensive).
    
- **If you want free + customizable → Quartz or MkDocs** (best balance).
    
- **If you need dynamic features → Wiki.js or Docusaurus** (self-hosted).
