## Strava (free trial)

Strava is one of the best running apps for all runners, and there are many serious athletes in the Strava network. I personally love Strava because it’s easy to use and a lot of my friends are on it so we can cheer each other on when posting our workouts. Strava is a GPS running app that tracks your pace and distance, and you can share your workouts with the Strava network. 

Strava allows you to track running, walking, and biking as well as enter your cross-training information if you want to post about your [circuit training](https://www.runstreet.com/blog/circuit-training-workouts) workouts, weightlifting, and more. I also appreciate the running safety feature called Strava Beacon, which allows you to share your location in real-time with trusted contacts so if you are doing a remote run or if you have a health condition, someone can always see where you are. 

As with many of the running apps, Strava does have premium paid options for training plans and advanced training stats. But for most people, the free app version is enough. [Sign up for Strava](https://www.strava.com/) and get started using it.

## Runkeeper

The ASICS [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/cms/) app is one of the most popular running apps for good reason - it allows you to track your runs easily and seamlessly integrates with other tracking devices like Apple watches. Runkeeper gives you to option to add reminders to tell yourself when to run, and the notifications will pop up on your phone. If you want a boost of extra motivation and direction, you can get a subscription and join the pro version, Runkeeper Go.

## Garmin Connect

[Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) is my running app of choice. It allows you to set running and fitness goals and track your workouts, which can include running, cycling, strength training, walking, and more. I use the [Garmin Forerunner 55](https://www.runstreet.com/blog/garmin-forerunner-55-review) running watch and the app syncs easily with the app. After getting overwhelmed with social media and notifications, I appreciate relying on my watch more than my phone for running, and syncing the watch with my Garmin is simple.

If you have a Garmin watch, you just need to sign up for the Garmin Connect app and open the app and watch the circle go around one full loop for it to sync with your watch. You don’t have to have a Garmin watch to use the app but you will have to manually enter your workouts if you don’t have a Garmin device. (Check out my [Garmin Running Workout Guide](https://www.runstreet.com/blog/garmin-running-workout) if you want more tips on using your Garmin and Garmin Connect).

## Nike Run Club

[Nike Run Club](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app) is one of the best running apps that’s easy to use, which I appreciate. Nike Run Club tracks your run distance and pace and your running routes. The app offers stats on your average pace, calories burned, and distance covered.

The Nike Run Club app also has challenges you can join. There is also a social aspect to the app, as you can add friends and cheer them on when you see their workout posts. Nike Run Club is a beginner-friendly app that also includes guided runs and free training plans that sync with an Apple Watch.

## MapMyRun

[MapMyRun](https://www.mapmyrun.com/) by Under Armour is one of the best running apps for creating running routes. I use this app a lot when I need to create routes for myself or for leading running events. I use the desktop version of the app to create routes and then bookmark the routes and pull them up easily on the app on my phone. The run tracker can also tell you your running pace and distance.

## Charity Miles

[CharityMiles](https://charitymiles.org) is great for raising money for charity while you run. It is one of the simpler running apps as far as technology, with a streamlined distance and time tracker to use as you run. The best part is the charity component which allows you to choose a charity to raise money for with each mile. You can get sponsorships to raise money for the charity and some charities also have already agreed upon sponsors who donate a set amount. The main drawback of this app in my opinion is there are only large charities so many of the smaller ones are not on the app.
