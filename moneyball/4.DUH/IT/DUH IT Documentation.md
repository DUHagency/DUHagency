### **1. Purpose & Use Cases**

|**Posts**|**Pages**|
|---|---|
|üìÖ **Time-sensitive content** (e.g., blog posts, news updates)|üìÑ **Static content** (e.g., About Us, Contact, Services)|
|üóÇÔ∏è Organized with **categories & tags**|üè∑Ô∏è **No categories/tags** (but can use custom taxonomies)|
|üîÑ Displayed in **reverse chronological order** (newest first)|üèõ **Hierarchical** (can have parent/child pages, like `/services/design`)|
|üìå Appears in **RSS feeds**|üö´ Typically excluded from feeds|

### **2. Technical Differences**

|Feature|**Posts**|**Pages**|
|---|---|---|
|**Default URL**|`/yyyy/mm/dd/post-name/`|`/page-name/`|
|**Comments**|‚úÖ Enabled by default|‚ùå Often disabled|
|**RSS**|Included|Excluded|
|**SEO**|Benefits from freshness signals|Better for evergreen content|
|**Custom Fields**|Supported|Supported|

### **3. When to Use Each**

- **Use Posts for:**
    
    - Blog articles
        
    - News updates
        
    - Time-sensitive content
        
    - Content you want to categorize/tag
        
- **Use Pages for:**
    
    - About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy
        
    - Landing pages
        
    - Hierarchical content (e.g., `/services/web-design`)
        
    - Static content that rarely changes
- 
## style
coding in md for style, split text boxs? invisible table with indent control
unlinked documents
new note made there link are added to the folder until tagging
good for the eyes
color blind for all users
brale print out
## doesn't have hashtags (intro)
- [[Tag pages]]
	- Based on popularity
		- Then based on personal interest and site usage
- Tags establish [[DUH authority points|authority]]
- Tags establish [[template/0.templater page|templates]]
	- Autofilll by tags
		- Countries etc.
- Misc Tag usage.
	- User
	- Temp
	- Moderation (in review, publishing soon, published)
		- Published with the change of the tag


## doesn't have traceable user authority
- [ ] hidden mode for certain headings for certain users
	- [ ] add toggle
- [ ] library sign in
https://developer.overdrive.com/
- can authority be assigned to library account
- [[libAuth.js]]
- https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management
- https://library.ohio.gov/residents/find-an-ohio-library/find-an-ohio-library

Could we do it through PEG stations?

## wiki doesn't have moderation dashboards
- based on what people fill out, it provide recommendations for points.
- Points go into % share of profit.

### 1. **Symbolic Links (Symlinks) for Selective Access**

- **How it works**: Use symbolic links to include only specific folders or files from your giant vault into a smaller vault.
    
- **Steps**:
    
    1. Create a new vault (e.g., `MiniVault`).
        
    2. Inside `MiniVault`, symlink only the folders/files you need from the giant vault.
        
        - On Linux/macOS:
            
            bash
            

- ln -s /path/to/GiantVault/ProjectA /path/to/MiniVault/ProjectA
    
- On Windows (Command Prompt as Admin):
    
    cmd
    

- 1. - mklink /D "C:\MiniVault\ProjectA" "C:\GiantVault\ProjectA"
            
- **Pros**: Lightweight; avoids duplication.
    
- **Cons**: Requires technical setup; may confuse Obsidian if files are moved.
    

---

### 2. **Git Submodules or Partial Checkouts**

- If your vault is version-controlled with Git:
    
    - Use **submodules** to clone only parts of the giant vault into a smaller vault.
        
    - Or use **sparse checkouts** (`git sparse-checkout init --cone`) to limit visible files.
        
- **Pros**: Good for collaboration/version control.
    
- **Cons**: Git knowledge required.
    

---

### 3. **Export/Import Subsets**

- Manually copy a subset of notes (e.g., by topic or tag) into a new vault.
    
- Use **Export** plugins (like `CSV Export` or `QuickExplorer`) to extract specific notes.
    
- **Pros**: Simple; no symlink/Git complexity.
    
- **Cons**: Duplicates files; no live sync with the main vault.
    

---

### 4. **Tags or Links for Cross-Vault Navigation**

- Work in a smaller vault but use **tags** (e.g., `#projectA`) or **wikilinks** (`[[NoteInGiantVault]]`) to reference the giant vault.
    
- Open both vaults simultaneously in Obsidian (requires multiple instances).
    
- **Pros**: No file duplication.
    
- **Cons**: Manual effort to switch contexts.
    

---

### 5. **Plugins for Modular Work**

- **Advanced URI**: Open notes from the giant vault in your smaller vault via `obsidian://` links.
    
- **Linter**: Clean up links after exporting subsets.
    
- **Sync Plugins**: Use `Syncthing` or `Remotely Save` to sync only specific folders.
    

---

### 6. **Separate Vaults with Shared Assets**

- Store attachments (images, PDFs) in a shared folder outside both vaults.
    
- Link to them from either vault (e.g., `../SharedAssets/image.png`).
    
- **Pros**: Reduces duplication.
    
- **Cons**: Paths must be consistent.
    

---

### Recommendation:

- For **lightweight access**, use **symlinks** or **partial Git checkouts**.
    
- For **one-time projects**, **export subsets**.
    
- For **long-term modularity**, combine **tags + multiple vaults**.
