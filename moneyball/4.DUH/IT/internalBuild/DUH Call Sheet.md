Connect to your database using a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library in your chosen server-side scripting language. For example, in PHP, you can use PDO or MySQLi to connect to a MySQL database.
Write a SQL query to retrieve the data you want to display on each web page. For example, to get every primary ID in a table, you can use a SELECT statement with the primary key column as the argument.
Use a loop or iterator in your server-side code to iterate through the results of the SQL query, and generate a separate web page for each result. For example, in PHP, you can use a foreach loop to iterate through the results and generate HTML code for each page.
Optionally, use a template engine or front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular to create a consistent layout and design for your web pages.
Publish your web pages to a web server or hosting provider, and test them in a web browser to ensure they display the data correctly.
