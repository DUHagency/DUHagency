# The plan
We need to effectively turn your Obsidian notes into a dynamic website and save time by also supporting a mobile app, the best strategy is to use a technology stack that allows you to share code and content between web and mobile platforms. Here’s how you can approach this:

## the future
We need to vitural host our own [[markdown editor|markdown editor]] that's [[Opensource]]

## current enplmentation


### 1. Build a Web App with a JavaScript Framework
- [[Javascript Libraries]]
- Vue.js
- React

### 2. Turn the Web App into a Mobile App

- Use **React Native** (for React) or frameworks like **Capacitor** or **Cordova** to wrap your web app as a native mobile app for [[iOS]] and [[Android]]
    
- This allows you to maintain a single codebase for both web and mobile, saving significant time and effort.
    

## 3. Sync Your Obsidian Vault

- Use Obsidian Sync or a cloud storage solution to ensure your notes are accessible to both the web and mobile versions of your app.
    
- Your app can read the markdown files directly or via an API.
    

## 4. Plugins and API Integration

- Obsidian has a rich plugin ecosystem, including mobile-compatible plugins, which can enhance your workflow and automate parts of the process[3](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Mobile-compatible+plugins)[4](https://obsidian.md/plugins).
    
- If you want advanced integration, you can use the **Obsidian API** to connect your app with Obsidian’s features or build custom interactions[6](https://github.com/wanadev/obsidian-api/blob/master/doc/example.md)[8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obsidian-api).
    

## Why This Saves Time

- **Single Source of Truth:** Your Obsidian vault remains the central content repository.
    
- **One Codebase:** Modern frameworks let you deploy to web and mobile with minimal extra work.
    
- **Dynamic Features:** You can add interactivity, search, and other dynamic features once and use them everywhere.
    

## Alternative: Use Obsidian’s Native Mobile App
