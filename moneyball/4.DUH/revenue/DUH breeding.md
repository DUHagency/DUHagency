## phase 1 growing

### indoor
Variegated, albinism, purple
### outdoor
Focusing on the backyard grower.  They want to plant it, forget about it, harvest it late, forget to pull all the males, etc, yet still smokeable bud.

## phase 2
I wanted potent, crazy yield, crazy tall, crazy wide, outdoor plants.

[[
]]# Current Projects
## indoor
### winter sticky
3 ft tall, incredibly potent.  Because of cold hardiness I've decided to seed indoors
## outdoor
### Rick Roll
Shade tolerant
Very Tall, very compact, very strong, can be used as privacy fence.  7 ft tall.


# defunct projects
## outdoor
### yellow macy
Extreme yield, high fertility, faster maturity.
### green tea
shade tolerant
We need to sell out of this
compact for apartment or small patio spaces.


# Later Projects
## Winter Projects
### Pretty Posh
Needs consideration towards orders

Traits
Purple and variegated.  Compacted for indoor grows.
