"Formerly known as Marine Harvest, Mowi is one of the largest seafood companies, with an estimated 25%-30% share of the global salmon and trout market. It's the world's largest producer of Atlantic salmon.

In 2020, the company brought in $4.3 billion in revenue, in part because of the disruption in restaurant and food service customers. Profits were lower than normal as salmon prices fell due to the effects of pandemic-related lockdowns. The company reported a profit of $137 million, down from more than $500 million in 2019, although that shows that the company generates healthy operating margins in a normal business environment." - [Motley Fool](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=Motley+Fool)
