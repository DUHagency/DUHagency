# goals
Tregity Farms came about while presuing a mission of the most clean, natural, productive process for cannabis possible. That is our brand, that is our product. We achieve that through our cloosed loop systems. Our cloosed loop aquaponics are the most bio diverse in World for cannabis production, and some of thee most bio diverse in all of agriculture (I can't find much lol).

here are our current types

- cold water
    

My assumptions are everything. The most species, in order to achieve prime goal, for cannabis production.

    1. salinity and species
    2. fish extrament or emulsion compostions
    3. tolerance of pollution
    4. max allowance for max fertilizers in the close loop
    5. hey whats the fish meat look (idk if you should eat fish of extreme 'polluated' system relatively speaking.

- compostions

[beans](https://localhost/tiki-26.2/tiki-editpage.php?page=beans)

- bruh there are clear signs that mutations for variegation in cow peas exist. I want to find that
- the most expensive, would we raw beans for restraunts, you will never beat out a dried operation farmer
    - peas
        - marketing Spanish peas are so sweet theyre good in ice cream (they are good because of the variety with seasonaility, so getting a more expensive crop would take breeding peas annuals or biannually (you could get two harvests)
    - green beans
        - breeding would fetch the highest price tag. Maybe people care about color.
- gunna want bush beans, something that can stand up on its own
- maybe you don't want that
- profit

profitable plants

- wasabi

- nitrogen

To understand nitrogen you need to understand ammonia, to nitrites. to nitrates  
Ammonia Assimilation: The ammonia produced by nitrogen fixation is then assimilated by the legume plant and incorporated into its metabolic processes. The plant uses the ammonia to synthesize various nitrogen-containing compounds, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.
