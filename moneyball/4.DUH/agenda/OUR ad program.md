# The question
- **Monetizing through advertising**
- **Earning revenue from ads**
- **Generating income via ad placements**
- **Ad-based revenue**
- **Getting paid via pay-per-click (PPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) models**
- **Sponsored content or paid promotion**
- **Earning through ad sponsorships**
- **Revenue from ad impressions or clicks**

# The only Way
[[DUH about us]] is committed to paying [[3.USER/authority/DUH authority points|authoritative bloggers]] all ad revenue percured through its pages to the corresponding writer.  However if authority leans another way, corresponding measures will be take to commission a new % to the other individual.
