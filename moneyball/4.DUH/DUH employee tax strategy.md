This doesn't consider [[DUH mega backdoor IRA]]
# **Key Assumptions (2024 Numbers)**

- **12% Bracket Cap:** $48,525 (Single filer)
    
- **Standard Deduction:** $14,600 (reduces taxable income further)
    
- **Goal:** Push **gross income as high as possible** while keeping taxable income ≤ $48,525.
    

---

# **Step 1: Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) Needed**

Since the **standard deduction** reduces taxable income:

- **Taxable Income = AGI – Standard Deduction**
    
- To max out the 12% bracket:
    
    - **$48,525 (Taxable Income) = AGI – $14,600**
        
    - **AGI = $63,125**
        

This means you can have an **AGI of $63,125** and still be in the 12% bracket.

# **Step 2: Deductions to Reduce AGI from Gross Income**

To get from a **high gross income → AGI of $63,125**, we’ll use:

|**Deduction**|**Max Contribution (2024)**|**Effect on AGI**|
|---|---|---|
|**Solo 401(k) (Employee + Employer)**|Up to **$69,000** (but limited by net income)|Let’s assume **$30,000**|
|**Has Contribution**|**$4,150 (Single)**|-$4,150|
|**SEP IRA** (if no 401k)|Up to **25% of net income**|Alternative option|
|**Self-Employed Health Insurance**|Full premium cost (e.g., **$7,000**)|-$7,000|
|**QBI Deduction (20% of qualified income)**|Varies (~$10k-$20k)|-$12,625 (example)|

## **Example Calculation**

Let’s say your **gross business income = $120,000**

- **Business Expenses (e.g., supplies, home office, etc.)** = **$10,000**
    
- **Net Business Profit = $110,000**
    

Now apply deductions:

1. **Solo 401(k):** -$30,000
    
2. **Has:** -$4,150
    
3. **Health Insurance Premiums:** -$7,000
    
4. **QBI Deduction (20% of $110k - ½ SE tax):** ~$19,800
    

**AGI = $110,000 – $30,000 – $4,150 – $7,000 – $19,800 = $49,050**  
(Close to our $48,525 target—could tweak contributions slightly.)

# **Step 3: Maximum Possible Gross Income While Staying in 12% Bracket**

If we **maximize every possible deduction**, how high can gross income go?

Assume:

- **Solo 401(k):** $30,000
    
- **Has:** $4,150
    
- **Health Insurance:** $7,000
    
- **QBI Deduction:** ~20% of remaining income
    
- **Business Expenses:** $20,000
    

**Math:**

- **AGI Target = $63,125**
    
- **Gross Income (X) – Deductions = $63,125**
    
- **$X – $30k (401k) – $4,150 (HSA) – $7k (Health) – $20k (Expenses) – (0.2 × (X – $61,150)) = $63,125**
    

Solving this, **gross income could be ~$150,000+** while keeping taxable income at $48,525.

# **Step 4: Take-Home Pay If You Just Took Income (No Deductions)**

If you **ignored all deductions** and took $48,525 as pure income:

- **Federal Tax (12%)** = $5,823
    
- **Self-Employment Tax (15.3%)** = $7,424
    
- **Take-Home Pay ≈ $48,525 – $5,823 – $7,424 = $35,278**
    

But with deductions, you could **take home much more** while still paying only 12% on taxable income.

# **Final Answer: Optimal Strategy for Max Take-Home in 12% Bracket**

|**Strategy**|**Amount**|
|---|---|
|**Gross Income Possible**|**$150,000+**|
|**AGI After Deductions**|**$63,125**|
|**Taxable Income (After Standard Deduction)**|**$48,525**|
|**Federal Tax (12%)**|**$5,823**|
|**Self-Employment Tax**|**~$12,716** (on ~$110k net)|
|**Total Tax Paid**|**~$18,539**|
|**Take-Home Pay (After Tax + Deductions)**|**~$90,000+** (including retirement/Has savings)|

# **Key Takeaways**

- You can **earn $150,000+** but only pay **12% federal tax** on $48,525 by maximizing deductions.
    
- **Take-home pay is much higher** than if you just took $48,525 as salary (since you keep retirement/Has funds).
    
- **Self-employment tax** is the bigger cost (~15.3%), but deductions help reduce it.
