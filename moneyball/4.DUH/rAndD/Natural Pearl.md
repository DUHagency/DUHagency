# indoor pearls

- **Obtain Live Mollusks:** You need live oysters (for saltwater pearls) or freshwater mussels (for freshwater pearls). These can sometimes be sourced from aquaculture suppliers[5](https://www.restonyc.com/can-i-grow-my-own-pearls/).
    
- **Tank Setup:** Prepare an appropriate tank—saltwater for oysters (such as Akoya oysters), or freshwater for mussels. The tank must be stable, clean, and suitable for the species you choose[5](https://www.restonyc.com/can-i-grow-my-own-pearls/).
    
- **Nucleation:** Pearls form when an irritant (usually a bead nucleus and a piece of mantle tissue) is inserted into the mollusk. This delicate process is typically performed with specialized tools and a steady hand[5](https://www.restonyc.com/can-i-grow-my-own-pearls/).
    
- **Care and Maintenance:** The mollusks require excellent water quality, proper feeding, and stable conditions. Supplements may be needed to support their health[5](https://www.restonyc.com/can-i-grow-my-own-pearls/).
    
- **Time:** Pearl formation is slow, often taking two or more years for a pearl to fully develop[5](https://www.restonyc.com/can-i-grow-my-own-pearls/).
