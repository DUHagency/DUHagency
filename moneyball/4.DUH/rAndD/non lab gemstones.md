[[lab grown gemstones]]
can we make a marketable gemstone (plenty of things are not valuable but incredibly rare)

| Gemstone                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Natural Pearl]]                              | Cultured pearls can be farmed, but true natural pearls (formed without human input) cannot be lab-created.                                               |
| Ammolite                                       | An organic gemstone from fossilized ammonite shells; its unique structure cannot be replicated in a lab.                                                 |
| Amber                                          | Fossilized tree resin; while imitations exist, true amber with ancient inclusions cannot be lab-grown.                                                   |
| Certain Opals                                  | While synthetic opals exist, some rare natural opal types (with unique play-of-color and inclusions) cannot be exactly duplicated in a lab.              |
| Alexandrite*                                   | High-quality, large, natural alexandrite with strong color change is extremely difficult to synthesize at scale, though small synthetic stones do exist. |
| Painite, Musgravite, Grandidierite, Taaffeite* | Some extremely rare collector stones have not been successfully synthesized due to their rarity and complex formation.                                   |
