# Overview of Ohio Cottage Food Law

Ohio's cottage food law allows individuals to produce and sell certain low-risk, non-potentially hazardous foods from their home kitchens without the need for a food license or routine inspections[](https://agri.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/oda/divisions/food-safety/resources/cottage-food)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/)[](https://www.greenecophoh.gov/environmental-health/food-safety/cottage-food-operations)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/LawBulletins/CottageFoodLaw.pdf)[](https://ofbf.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Food-Guide-Cottage-Foods.pdf). The law is designed to encourage small-scale, home-based food businesses while maintaining food safety for consumers.

## **What Foods Are Allowed?**
**Freeze-drying is not permitted as a "Cottage Food Production Operation".**
Only specific foods that do not require refrigeration or special temperature controls are permitted. Examples include:

- [[Baked goods]] (that don’t require refrigeration)
    https://www.31daily.com/30-easy-summer-picnic-desserts/
- [[Candy]] (excluding those with fresh fruit)
    https://bakeorbreak.com/2013/05/weekly-mix-desserts-for-outdoor-parties/
- [[Jams]] and [[jellies]] (excluding freezer and sugar-free varieties)
    https://www.spatuladesserts.com/picnic-desserts/
- [[Fruit butters]] and non-acidified chutneys
    
- [[Granola]] and [[granola bars]]
    
- [[Honey Flavored honey]] (by exempt beekeepers)
    
- [[Popcorn]] and [[popcorn balls]]
    
- Unfilled baked [[donuts]], [[pizzelles]], [[waffle cones]]
    dry cereal
    nut snack mixing
    chips
    
-[[ Dry mixes]], [[herbs and spices]], [[teas]], [[roasted coffee]], and [[seasoning blends]][](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/blog-tags/cottage-foods)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/Cottage%20Food%20Law%20Bulletin.pdf)
    

Foods that require refrigeration, such as cheesecakes, salsas, or cream cheese frostings, are not allowed unless you obtain a home bakery license[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/Cottage%20Food%20Law%20Bulletin.pdf).

## **Sales and Distribution**

- Products can be sold directly to consumers from your home, at farmers markets, registered farm markets, grocery stores, and certain festivals (lasting no more than seven consecutive days)[](https://www.foodtruckprofit.com/cottage-food-laws/ohio)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/).
    
- All sales must occur within Ohio; interstate sales are not permitted[](https://www.foodtruckprofit.com/cottage-food-laws/ohio)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/).
    
- Cottage foods can also be sold to restaurants for use in food preparation[](https://www.foodtruckprofit.com/cottage-food-laws/ohio)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/).
    

## **Labeling Requirements**

Each product must have a label that includes:

- Product name
    
- Net weight (in both U.S. customary and metric units)
    
- Ingredient list in descending order by weight
    
- Business name and address
    
- The statement: “This Product is Home Produced” in at least ten-point type[](https://www.foodtruckprofit.com/cottage-food-laws/ohio)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/LawBulletins/CottageFoodLaw.pdf)
    

## **Licensing and Inspections**

- Cottage food operations are exempt from licensing and routine inspections[](https://agri.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/oda/divisions/food-safety/resources/cottage-food)[](https://www.greenecophoh.gov/environmental-health/food-safety/cottage-food-operations)[](https://ofbf.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Food-Guide-Cottage-Foods.pdf).
    
- However, the Ohio Department of Agriculture may sample products to ensure compliance with labeling and safety standards[](https://www.greenecophoh.gov/environmental-health/food-safety/cottage-food-operations)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/LawBulletins/CottageFoodLaw.pdf)[](https://ofbf.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Food-Guide-Cottage-Foods.pdf).
    

## **Other Key Points**

- No food safety training is required, but obtaining food safety certification is recommended for credibility and expanded opportunities[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/).
    
- The home kitchen must be in the primary residence, with only one stove or oven used for production[](https://ofbf.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Food-Guide-Cottage-Foods.pdf).
    
- If your product is not on the approved list, you must obtain appropriate licensing and possibly undergo inspections[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/Cottage%20Food%20Law%20Bulletin.pdf).
    

**In summary:**  
Ohio’s cottage food law provides a straightforward path for home-based food entrepreneurs to sell certain non-hazardous foods within the state, with clear labeling and sales restrictions, and without the burden of licensing and routine inspection[](https://agri.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/oda/divisions/food-safety/resources/cottage-food)[](https://foodsafepal.com/ohio-cottage-food-law/)[](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/sites/aglaw/files/site-library/LawBulletins/CottageFoodLaw.pdf)[](https://ofbf.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Food-Guide-Cottage-Foods.pdf). Always check the most current list of approved foods and requirements before starting your business.
