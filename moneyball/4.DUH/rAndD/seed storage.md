| Levels of Relative Humidity | ### Effects of Humidity on Cannabis Seeds                                       |
| **80 - 100 %**              | Seeds germinate.                                                                |
| **40 - 60 %**               | Seeds increase respiration and seed storage fungi become a significant problem. |
| **20 - 30 %**               | Short-term storage.                                                             |
| **18 - 20 %**               | Medium-term storage.                                                            |
| **12 - 14 %**               | Long-term storage.                                                              |
| **8 - 9%**                  | Shorter longevity than seeds stored at a slightly higher humidity.              |
Yes, cannabis seeds can be stored in the freezer. The lower the temperature, the slower they decline. However, itâ€™s usually not necessary to freeze your seeds.
