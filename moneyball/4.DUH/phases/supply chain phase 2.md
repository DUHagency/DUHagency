Connect to your database using a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library in your chosen server-side scripting language. For example, in PHP, you can use PDO or MySQLi to connect to a MySQL database.  
Write a SQL query to retrieve the data you want to display on each web page. For example, to get every primary ID in a table, you can use a SELECT statement with the primary key column as the argument.  
Use a loop or iterator in your server-side code to iterate through the results of the SQL query, and generate a separate web page for each result. For example, in PHP, you can use a foreach loop to iterate through the results and generate HTML code for each page.  
Optionally, use a template engine or front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular to create a consistent layout and design for your web pages.  
Publish your web pages to a web server or hosting provider, and test them in a web browser to ensure they display the data correctly.  
The marketplace (Year 2)  
Create a system where customers can browse and order seeds from multiple vendors on your website, but the actual fulfillment and shipping of the orders would be handled by the respective vendors. To do this, you would need to establish partnerships or agreements with the seed vendors to allow you to sell their products on your website.  
Once you have established these partnerships, you can set up a checkout system on your website that allows customers to select the seeds they want to purchase, enter their shipping and payment information, and submit their orders. Once the order is submitted, you would then forward the relevant details to the appropriate seed vendor(s) who would be responsible for fulfilling the order and shipping it directly to the customer.  
It's important to ensure that you have agreements in place with each vendor that outline the terms of the partnership, including things like payment processing, shipping, and handling fees, and any other relevant details. You should also ensure that your website clearly communicates the fact that the seeds are being shipped directly from the vendor so that customers understand the process and don't have any unrealistic expectations.  
Building a system that allows customers to purchase products from multiple third-party vendors through your website requires a multi-vendor e-commerce platform. There are several e-commerce platforms available that support multi-vendor functionality, such as WooCommerce, Shopify, and Magento.  
You can set up your website using one of these platforms and then integrate it with payment gateways and shipping providers to streamline the checkout and shipping processes. Once you have the website set up, you can reach out to the seed vendors you want to work with and negotiate terms for selling their products on your website.  
Some of the key features to look for in a multi-vendor e-commerce platform include:  
Multi-vendor support: The platform should allow multiple vendors to register and sell their products on your website.  
Product management: The platform should enable vendors to manage their product listings, pricing, and inventory.  
Commission management: The platform should allow you to set commission rates for each vendor and automatically calculate payouts.  
Order management: The platform should provide tools to manage orders, shipping, and tracking information for each vendor.  
Payment gateways: The platform should support multiple payment gateways, including those preferred by your vendors.  
Reporting and analytics: The platform should provide you and your vendors with insights into sales, customer behavior, and other vital metrics.  
Setting up a multi-vendor e-commerce platform can be complex, and it may require some technical expertise. You may consider hiring a web developer or agency to help you build and maintain the platform.

Vendor requirements  
To become certified organic, a farm or business must undergo a certification process with a USDA-accredited certifying agent. This process involves meeting strict standards that cover all aspects of the operation, including soil quality, pest, and weed control, use of approved materials, and record-keeping. The certifying agent will review the farm's application and inspect the operation to ensure compliance with the organic regulations. The certifying agent will also conduct periodic inspections to ensure ongoing compliance with the regulations. Once the farm or business has been certified, it may use the USDA organic seal on its products and label them as organic.
