You can take the bar exam without a law degree in four states: **California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington**. These states allow you to qualify through a structured legal apprenticeship or "reading the law" program under the supervision of a practicing attorney or judge, instead of attending law school[](https://www.juriseducation.com/blog/can-you-take-the-bar-exam-without-going-to-law-school)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rzzm63/i_am_an_attorney_who_passed_the_bar_without/)[](https://barprephero.com/learn/take-the-bar-exam-without-law-school/)[](https://www.shareable.net/how-to-become-a-lawyer-without-going-to-law-school/)[](https://www.lsd.law/articles/taking-the-bar-exam-without-law-school)[](https://www.lawyeredu.org/bar-exam-without-law-school/)[](https://lawofficestudy.net/2023/03/17/states-you-can-become-a-lawyer-without-law-school/)[](https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/law-admissions-lowdown/articles/what-law-school-applicants-should-know-about-the-bar-exam).

- **California**: No undergraduate degree is strictly required if you can demonstrate equivalent knowledge, and you must pass the First-Year Law Student’s Exam (“baby bar”) after your first year of apprenticeship[](https://www.juriseducation.com/blog/can-you-take-the-bar-exam-without-going-to-law-school)[](https://lawofficestudy.net/2023/03/17/states-you-can-become-a-lawyer-without-law-school/).
    
- **Vermont, Virginia, and Washington**: Require a bachelor’s degree and completion of a multi-year apprenticeship under a licensed attorney or judge[](https://www.juriseducation.com/blog/can-you-take-the-bar-exam-without-going-to-law-school)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rzzm63/i_am_an_attorney_who_passed_the_bar_without/)[](https://lawofficestudy.net/2023/03/17/states-you-can-become-a-lawyer-without-law-school/).
    

**New York and Maine** offer hybrid paths: you must complete at least one year (NY) or two years (ME) of law school, then finish your legal education through an apprenticeship before sitting for the bar[](https://www.juriseducation.com/blog/can-you-take-the-bar-exam-without-going-to-law-school)[](https://www.lawyeredu.org/bar-exam-without-law-school/).
