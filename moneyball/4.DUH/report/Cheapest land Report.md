## Why
Idk but [[ISP]]  and [[Cottage Law]].  This leads to franchising for B2B. We have the best food, and we sell food.  Easy to attach to something anyone can do.  

Build to the best of the best ghost kitchen donating food, and using food for influence.  We touch fame with great food.  Easies to get branding back, and etc.

Why, it focuses on businesses out of residential areas.  As products increase popularity buy land.

## [[New Mexico]]

Although New Mexico’s geography is surprisingly diverse and includes forested mountains, green valleys, and grasslands, much of the state is desert. This results in New Mexico being one of thde cheapest states to buy land. The Chihuahuan Desert runs through the southern part of the state and you can buy affordable land for sale in Deming as low as $200 per acre.

In the central part of the state, where there’s remote desert, you can also find [cheap land for sale in New Mexico](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/new-mexico). For example, outside Bosque, you may come across land under $100 per acre.

## [[Nevada]]

Nevada is one of the cheapest places to buy land, because it’s home to a large amount of remote desert. Northern Nevada is located in the Great Basin. This is a desert area with hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures. In areas outside of cities like Wells, Lovelock, and Winnemucca, you can buy [cheap land for sale in Nevada](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/nevada) in the $100-$200 per acre range.

## [[Arizona]]

Another place to buy cheap land is in Arizona. Although parts of Arizona are home to forests, canyons, and even ski resorts, much of southern and western Arizona is arid desert land. It’s known for having extremely hot summers, and mild winters, and is home to plants such as the cactus.

Although you can buy [cheap land for sale in Arizona](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/arizona) throughout the state, you’ll have the most success by looking west and south. Near cities like Wikieup, Kingman, Meadview, and Bullhead City in western Arizona you can often find low-cost land for sale in the $250-$500 per acre range. And in southern areas around Douglas, Hereford, Bisbee, and McNeal, you can buy $400-$600 per acre properties.

Remote land in Maine

## [[Maine]]

Maine is also home to some of America's cheapest land. While it’s certainly not desert land, it’s located in a part of New England known for its jagged coastline and heavily forested timberland. It’s the most northeastern U.S. state and one of the least densely populated.

There’s a lot of unorganized state territory consisting of over 420 townships. As a result, much of the land in Maine is extremely secluded and remote, with no signs of civilization in sight. Also, land in Maine tends to come in large parcels, which can lower the average price per acre.

If you’re looking for [cheap land for sale in Maine](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/maine), the eastern portion of the state is a good place to start, specifically the Northeast. In northeastern towns like Van Buren, Connor Township, and Castle Hill you can buy remote properties sometimes as low as $450-$800 per acre. In certain eastern towns like Amity, Cary, Dyer Brook, and Linneus you can buy tracts for $400-700 per acre.

There’s also some very affordable land further south in places like Perkins Township, Franklin, and Hermon for $575-$800 per acre.

## [[Michigan]]

Michigan is home to some cheap land for the same reason as Maine. It’s essentially 2 large peninsulas—the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. Even though the state has a large population, there are very remote and sparsely-populated regions, especially the Upper Peninsula. There you can buy large tracts of hunting land, cabin properties, and other recreational acreage.

You’ll even see land with water features come on the market for affordable prices. This is due to the remote, off-the-grid nature of the geography. The peninsula is in the extreme North and surrounded by Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Huron.

If you’re searching for [cheap land for sale in Michigan](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/michigan), check out the Upper Peninsula. You’ll see land prices as low as $250-$600 per acre.

## [[Colorado]]

Colorado is one of the cheapest states to buy land. This comes as a surprise to a lot of people, but not so much to people who live there. While it has some very expensive real estate in places like Aspen and Steamboat Springs, it’s also home to desert and inhospitable mountain land. It also tends to sell in large parcels. Surprisingly, you can buy [cheap land for sale in Colorado](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/colorado) throughout the state, but it’s more common outside the central mountains.

In the eastern plains and especially the Southeast around cities like Kim, Campo, Eads, and Hasty, you can buy land for sale for $680-$1,000 per acre. In the West, you’ll find some desert-like conditions mixed with mountainous terrain. Here you can find land on the market for $500-900 per acre.

Down South in places such as Walsenburg, Del Norte, and Moffat, prices can be as low as $750-$1,000 per acre. Even in the central part of the state, in sites like Yoder, you can buy parcels for under $1,000 per acre.

## [[Texas]]

Many people think of desert land when they think of Texas. But actually, less than 10% of land in Texas is considered desert. It’s home to a variety of landscapes including coastline, forests, and grasslands. Since Texas is so large, around 10% is still over 17 million desert acres which means it has some of the cheapest land in the United States.

If you’re shopping for [cheap land for sale in Texas](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/texas), almost the entire western portion of Texas along the western New Mexico and southern Mexican border is desert. For example, in western areas like Sierra Blanca and Monahans, you can find land as cheap as $350-$600 per acre. Towards the Mexican border, around cities such as Dryden and Sanderson, you can buy land as low as $350-$500 per acre.

## [[Oregon]]

Oregon is one of the United States’ most geographically diverse states. You’ll find everything from dense forests and volcanoes to crystal-clear lakes, mountains, and the Pacific coastline. In addition to that, it’s also home to desert and shrubland, which is where you can buy cheap land for sale. If you’re looking for [cheap land for sale in Oregon](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/oregon), the western and southern parts of the state are good places to start your search.

Around cities like Adel, Plush, and Bonanza, you can buy land in the $250-$650 per acre range. As you move north to areas around Christmas Valley, Summer Lake, Brothers, and then Service Creek, you’ll find land prices as low as $300-$700 per acre.

## [[Utah]]

Similar to Oregon and a few other states mentioned, Utah has diverse geography. Most of the population is found in the Wasatch Front running down the center of the state. A large amount of the state is made up of rugged terrain, arid desert, and other challenging landscapes. Because of this, you can buy [cheap land for sale in Utah](https://www.landsearch.com/cheap/utah) across much of the state, especially the extremes.

In the Northwest areas like Grouse Creek, you can sometimes find parcels for sale for as low as $150 per acre. At times, in central Oregon, parcels come on the market for $350-$750 per acre outside cities such as Delta and Fillmore. And in the South, you can buy land in areas around Beryl for $375-$600 per acre.
