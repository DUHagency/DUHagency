# Where is our Island
You are on a stranded island.  Ironically enough you have an international team of day traders, financial anyalasts and risk officers that work on this island. You as well need to provide full functionality to [[streamers]] You need to be a resource for the populations on the islands around you; so you as well function as logistic center.  Both islands are only inhabited by employees.  They are large enough for agriculture.  All products bought, must mean strict [[DUH products standards]].  Employees must not quit, you have an unlimited budget.  Your island only has one massive order a year.  If you need something after your order, you have to pay an insane amount of money!  This include employee clothes, and medical needs.  This is a report for the analysis of [[OUR True Color (mission statement)#self sufficiency|self sufficiency]].
