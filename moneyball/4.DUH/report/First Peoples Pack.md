**Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (North Carolina, Qualla Boundary):**  
Cherokee is still spoken and is the official language of the Cherokee Nation. There are significant numbers of speakers of all ages on the Qualla Boundary, and Cherokee immersion schools and community programs are helping to grow new speakers. The language is used in schools, church services, ceremonial events, and daily life, and the number of speakers is increasing due to revitalization efforts[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States)- .
    
- **Some Iroquoian Nations in New York (e.g., Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawk):**  
    There are still first-language speakers among the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) nations, especially Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca, though numbers are small and most speakers are elders. Language revitalization programs are ongoing, but everyday intergenerational use is limited compared to Cherokee[](https://lingspace.pages.wm.edu/indigenous-languages-north-america/)
    
- .
    
- **Michigan Anishinaabe Tribes (Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi):**  
    In Michigan, Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) and related languages are still spoken, but the number of fluent speakers is very low and mostly among elders. Tribes are racing to save their languages from extinction with immersion schools and cultural programs[](https://www.bridgemi.com/quality-life/michigan-tribes-race-save-their-language-extinction)
    
- .
    
- **Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan (Connecticut), Wampanoag (Massachusetts):**  
    These tribes have active language reclamation and teaching efforts, but there are few or no native speakers left. Most communication in these languages is in educational or ceremonial contexts.
