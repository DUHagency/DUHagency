# The crazy points
Anchorage's airport makes it an S-Tier Potential City.
- [[Tokyo]], Japan: A major international hub with extensive connections across Asia and the Pacific. Tokyo (Narita and Haneda airports) is a key gateway for business and tourism.
    
- [[Seoul]], South Korea: Incheon Airport is a major hub connecting Northeast Asia and beyond, with strong business and cultural ties.
    
- [[Beijing]], China: Capital city and major international airport serving northern China and connecting to many domestic and international destinations.
    
- [[Shanghai]], China: One of the busiest airports globally, a major financial center with extensive international flights.
    
- [[Hong Kong]]: A major international financial and transit hub with wide-reaching connections.
    
- [[Singapore]]: Key Southeast Asian hub with many connecting flights throughout Asia and globally.
    
- [[Bangkok]], Thailand: A major tourist and business hub in Southeast Asia, with extensive regional connections.
    
- [[Delhi]], India: A major South Asian hub with growing international traffic.
    
- [[Guangzhou]], China: Important commercial center with a large international airport serving southern China.
    
- [[Taipei]], Taiwan: A significant hub in East Asia with numerous international connections.
    

These cities represent the largest and most influential air travel hubs in Asia and would be critical for Anchorage to connect with to facilitate passenger and cargo flows between North America and Asia efficiently. Anchorage’s location makes it well-suited as a refueling or transfer point on transpacific routes, especially for flights between North America and Northeast and Southeast Asia[](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-anchorage-anc)
