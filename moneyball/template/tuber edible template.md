### grafting
- **Whip and Tongue Graft**: A common method where a piece of the desired apple variety (scion) is grafted onto a rootstock.
- **Cleft Graft**: Used for larger rootstock, where a wedge-shaped scion is inserted into a split in the rootstock.
- **Bark Graft**: Ideal for larger trees, involves placing the scion between the bark and wood of the rootstock.
### Layering
1. **Air Layering**: Involves wounding a branch and encouraging root growth while still attached to the parent plant.
2. **Ground Layering**: Bending a low branch to the ground, covering a portion with soil, and allowing it to root before severing from the parent plant.
### Budding
1. **T-Budding**: A single bud from the desired apple variety is inserted under the bark of the rootstock.
2. **Chip Budding**: Involves cutting a chip of wood and bark with a bud and placing it into a matching cut on the rootstock.
### Cuttings
