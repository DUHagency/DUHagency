Blind?
According to recent studies, about 1% of the U.S. population is considered legally blind, which means their vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the better eye. This translates to approximately 3.4 million Americans being legally blind. Additionally, about 20% of people over the age of 85 experience permanent vision loss, which includes blindness.

# cultural market axiom
Cultural markets are broken down into different variables for macro context.  But we must prioritize these values in order to supersede the basics to assign proper value.  This will determine a derivative structure coherent to intrinsic value.  Intrinsic value will be limited to its transportation ratio.  For instance if you have to drive from C10olumbus to Cleveland to access an asset.  Overwhelming great values negates the travel time.

## Local Value (Destination Cultural Distinguished Values)

Destination Cultural Distinguished Values or the DCV, is one unit that determines the proper cultural pursuit for ones ease of ability to acquire local agency.
